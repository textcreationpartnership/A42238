            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE Giving ſome Account of the Author, and of this Work.</head>
            <p>THE Name of this Author hath been ſo illuſtrious in theſe Weſtern parts of the World, that as there are few perſons who read Books to whom it is not known; ſo there needs no more to recommend this Work, and procure it entertainment, with all thoſe that have heard of him. In which he hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid out thoſe great Talents of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and learning, wherewith God bleſſed him above moſt other Men, in the defence of his moſt holy Religion. Which he hath ſerved very much in other works of his; but in none more than this: becauſe it is of ſuch General uſe, and ſo ſatisfactory, that it may alone merit thoſe titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which the Men of learning have
<pb facs="tcp:94132:5"/>
beſtowed on him; though they be as high, as well can be deviſed.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more ordinary in our <hi>Selden,</hi> than <hi>vir Maximus, vir ſummus,</hi> the greateſt, the chief of Men; when he ſpeaks of <hi>Grotius.</hi> Upon whom <hi>Salmaſius</hi> beſtows the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, moſt excellent; and as if he were in a rapture when he thought of him, cries out, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>O moſt admirable, or wonderful,</hi> and <hi>ſupereminentiſſime,</hi> moſt ſupereminent <hi>Grotius!</hi> to whom he wiſhed much rather to be like, than to be the moſt eminent perſon, for riches and honour, in the whole World. I ſhall only add the character, which <hi>Baudius</hi> gave of him very early, <hi>1612.</hi> in a <hi>Scazon</hi> he made upon him; where he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires him.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vir magne, vir mirande, vir ſine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>In Engliſh.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>O thou great Man, thou wonderful Man, a Man without example.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Yet as great a Man as he was, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:94132:5"/>
diſgrace in his own Country, and was thrown into Priſon (every body knows) in the Caſtle of <hi>Lupſtein.</hi> In which ſtrict confinement he meditated many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Works, eſpecially in things Sacred. For, during his long Impriſonment, he found by a happy experience (as he writes to <hi>Barlaeus</hi> a great while after) there was <hi>a wonderful power in the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to ſupport the mind, and to keep it erect againſt all calamities.</hi> And therefore for his own ſolace, in the firſt place, (as he tells another Friend) he ſet himſelf to write this little Book: which he intimates both in the beginning and in the concluſion of it, was then compoſed, or rather haſtily put together, when his Mind was more free than his Body. And therefore (when after ſeveral Editions he ſet it forth with Annotations, 1640.) he calls it in an Epiſtle to <hi>Sarravius, Partum doloris quondam mei,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The child of my grief in time paſt; now a Monument of my Thankſgiving to God.</hi> And as it was written originally in his own Language; ſo it was in Verſe; that it might be more popular, and more
<pb facs="tcp:94132:6"/>
eaſily committed to memory, by the rudeſ people: ſuch as Mariners, for whom he chiefly intended it. He tells us as much in the Preface; but we may learn it more fully out of a Letter to him, on this ſubject, from <note place="margin">Inter Epiſt. Praeſt. vir. <hi>p.</hi> 630.</note> 
               <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopius.</hi> Who ſays, that the oftner he read over thoſe <hi>Rythmes,</hi> the more he was rapt both into love, and admiration of them. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in them which was not moſt neceſſary to be known; and was able to incline the hardeſt heart to embrace this holy Religion. <hi>For it was hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,</hi> he ſays, <hi>whether the Majeſty of the things, or the clearneſs and ſweetneſs of the expreſſions were moſt to be commended: the Majeſty of the matter not at all hindring the clearneſs of the Verſe, nor its being tyed to Verſe, at all diluting or enervating the Majeſty of the matter.</hi> Such a ſtrife there was between theſe two, with equal ſucceſs; that it became a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was more divine to be able to have a ſolid and diſtinct conception in his mind of things ſo difficult and ſublime; or,
<pb facs="tcp:94132:6"/>
having conceived them to cloath them in ſuch comely and perſpicuous words; that at the firſt glance every Reader under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his great ſenſe, though bound up and fettered within the laws of verſe.</p>
            <p>Which way I ſuppoſe he choſe, becauſe it was the ancient manner of delivering the moſt uſeful things; as he himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to <hi>Stobaeus</hi> his <hi>Florilegium;</hi> which was written not long after this Book. Where, as a proof of it, he alledges that of <hi>Homer;</hi> who ſays, <hi>Clytaemneſtra,</hi> did not incline to vice, till ſhe had loſt him, that was wont to ſing to her. For precepts of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſo taught are exceeding charming to the minds of Youth; being not only more eaſily imprinted on the memory, but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affections more powerfully, and to the very quick, than when otherwiſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large. And therefore the publick Laws were in the moſt ancient times thus written, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> informs us: and that true Religion might be more eaſily conveyed into Peoples minds, and fixed there, <hi>Apolinarius</hi> tranſlated all the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us,
<pb facs="tcp:94132:7"/>
L. <hi>vi.</hi> cap. 18.) and the reſt of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Bible, as far as the reign of <hi>Saul,</hi> into Heroick verſe; in imitation of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſays, he put the whole old Teſtament into ſuch Verſe; and it is not improbable, for what he did upon the <hi>Pſalms</hi> is ſtill remaining.</p>
            <p>If it were my preſent buſineſs, I could trace this way of Inſtruction down to our own times; and through our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in which it hath been very effectual, as the ſtory of <hi>Aldelmus</hi> ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. Who firſt brought in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Latine verſe among the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> a little before <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors time; and by his excellent faculty in ſinging, wrought ſuch wonderful effects upon the People, for the civilizing of their manners, and for their inſtruction in the duties of Religion: that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> by his own Authority, thought good to make him a Saint.</p>
            <p>The very ſame charms <hi>Grotius</hi> hoped would have the ſame effect upon the rude Seamen of his Country: into whom he deſired by his Rymes, not only to inſtil a ſenſe of piety; but to inable them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb facs="tcp:94132:7"/>
it to other Nations, with whom they traded. And it ſeems this work was ſo much famed, that it moved the curioſity of a great man in <hi>France</hi> (into which <hi>Grotius</hi> went after his wonderful eſcape, 1621. out of that Priſon, or rather Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, as he calls it in a Letter to a Friend, wherein it was firſt projected) to ask him very often, what the Contents of that Book were, which he had written in <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon this ſubject of Religion. Whom he ſatisfied, by tranſlating the ſenſe of it into the Latine Tongue, in the Year 1628. and addreſſing it unto that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon, who made the inquiry, <hi>viz. Hieronymus Bignonius.</hi> Who together with <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> the famous Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> (a notable Judge of Wits) was wont to ſay <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. Cl. <hi>Sarravii. p.</hi> 146.</note>, were the only Perſons of that Age, whom he lookt upon, as arrived to the higheſt pitch of Learning.</p>
            <p>In which Tranſlation, he tells <hi>Sarravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> in a Letter to him that Year, he ſhould find, if nothing elſe, that he had at leaſt indeavoured <hi>brevity with perſpicuity.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94132:8"/>
Which made it ſo acceptable every where, though no longer in Verſe but now in Proſe, that in the Year 1632. I find (he tells <hi>Cordeſius</hi> another Learned Man in France <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. ad <hi>Gallos, p.</hi> 331. 417.</note>) it was gone the <hi>third</hi> time to the Preſs; with ſome Additions. But not with ſo many, it ſeems, as ſome deſired; for there were thoſe who wiſhed he would have anſwered a Book of <hi>Bodins,</hi> which ſeemed to impugn it. This he thought a needleſs pains, <hi>for whatſoever it is,</hi> ſaith he (in a Letter to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. pag. 407.</note>) <hi>that ſeems to ſhake the foundations I have laid (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Chriſtian Faith relies) I have already obviated it; as far as is neceſſary to perſwade a Reader that is not pertinacious. As for thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which are commonly received in Chriſtianity, but without the exact knowledge of which, we may be Chriſtians; they do not belong to my Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Year alſo (1632) I find it Tranſlated here into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Which He himſelf afterwards
<pb facs="tcp:94132:8"/>
takes notice of, in a Letter to <hi>Gerrard Voſſius,</hi> 1638 <note n="*" place="margin">Inter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>p.</hi> 748.</note>. Where he tells him, that there were (beſide the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> two <hi>High-Dutch</hi> Tranſlations of this Book; one <hi>French;</hi> and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's Chaplain was turning it into <hi>Greek;</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue: that by <hi>God</hi>'s bleſſing it might convert the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None of theſe could ſee any <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> (or other dangerous hereſie) in it; which ſome of the duller ſort of learned Men, were forward to charge it with all: becauſe he doth not directly prove in this Book the Doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity. Of which he gives this account in the forenamed Letter; that he heard a great <q>Man (who was <hi>Franc. Junius,</hi> as I take it) condemn <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and others, for endeavouring to prove that Myſtery by reaſons fetcht from Nature, and by <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonical</hi> Teſtimonies; (ſometimes not very pertinent) which ought not to came
<pb facs="tcp:94132:9"/>
into a Diſputation with <hi>Atheiſts, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans:</hi> who muſt all be firſt drawn to believe the holy Scriptures; that from thence they may learn ſuch things, as cannot be known, but by Divine Revelation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Reaſon he medled not with the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> directly: But if any body doubted of his Orthodoxy in this Point, They might ſee (he tells him in another Letter) what his opinion was, in his <hi>Poems</hi> then newly come forth; and the larger explication of it he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his <hi>Notes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the ſame cauſe he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly treat of ſome other things; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly about the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> for which omiſſion this Book was blamed, as <hi>Sarravius</hi> writes to him, by ſome who had nothing elſe to do, but to find fault with the labours of others. To which <hi>Grotius</hi> returned ſuch an Anſwer, as not only gave him, he tells us, moſt full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb facs="tcp:94132:9"/>
in thoſe two Points; but inabled him to ſilence thoſe accuſers. He doth not intimate indeed what that reply was; but as to the former Point it is apparent from his Annotations, that he believed our Saviour to be indeed <hi>God</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And that paſſage in the Concluſion of the <hi>xxi. Section</hi> of the <hi>fifth Book,</hi> concerning the Meſſias being called in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by the Name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> I ſhould have tranſlated thus—<hi>The Meſſias is called by that auguſt Name of God Jehovah,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Lord, viz.</hi> ELOHIM and ADONAI. For ſo he explains himſelf, I have ſince taken notice, in his Annotations; and adds this obſervation, that the <hi>Talmud</hi> in <hi>Taanith</hi> ſays, that when the time ſhall come, ſpoken of <hi>xxv. Iſa. 8, 9. (i. e.</hi> of the Meſſiah) <hi>Jehovah ſhall be ſhown, as we ſay, with the finger:</hi> that is, Men ſhall be able to point others to him, ſaying, Lo there is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the other thing, it is poſſible his Anſwer might be to the ſame purpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:94132:10"/>
with what he writ to <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Viror. p. 747.</note> 
               <hi>Voſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> In which he tells him, that if any one deſired to know (as he had already ſignified in a Letter, to one that ſaid he was accuſed of <hi>Socinianiſm)</hi> what his opinion was in the buſineſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſatisfaction, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſince <hi>Crellius</hi> had written againſt him; it would appear plainly enough out of his Tranſlation of the <hi>LIII.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in his Diſputation againſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> (which you may find here in the <hi>V. Book, Sect. 19.)</hi> and from hence alſo that in the Concluſion of this Work of <hi>the Truth of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> he doth not interpret thoſe words, <hi>i. Hebr. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in the preſent tenſe, <hi>making a purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>expiating our ſins,</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth; but in the paſt time <hi>expiatis peccatis noſtris, having expiated,</hi> or <hi>purged away our ſins.</hi> How they come to be otherwiſe Tranſlated in his Annotations on that place, put forth ſince his death, I can give no Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94132:10"/>
And in like manner, I ſuppoſe, he ſatisfied another doubt about a paſſage in this Book, which <hi>Sarravius</hi> deſired him to reſolve; though I cannot find his Anſwer to it: For he gives a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Anſwer afterward to a Queſtion propounded by a Miniſter of <hi>Rouen;</hi> who askt him, where he had that of <hi>Rabbi Nechumias,</hi> who made that publick Declaration (mentioned in the <hi>Fifth Book, Sect. 14.)</hi> concerning the appearing of Chriſt, 50. Years before our Saviour; to this effect: <hi>That the time which</hi> Daniel <hi>had prefixed for the coming of the Meſſiah, could not be prolonged above thoſe Fifty Years.</hi> Which he tells <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. Claud. <hi>Sarrav.</hi> p. 52.</note> is to be found in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> in the Title <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> (as he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) and he thought alſo in <hi>Abenada</hi> upon <hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was in the Year 1640. when he firſt put out this Book with <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;</hi> containing the Teſtimonies of
<pb facs="tcp:94132:11"/>
thoſe Authors, in words at length; whom he had alledged: but had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, it ſeems, to ſet down where he had this paſſage of Rabbi <hi>Nechumias.</hi> Nor is it now to be found among the Annotations; and therefore they that next Print the Book ſo inlarged, will do well to ſupply it from hence, out of <hi>Sarravius.</hi> Who was the firſt Perſon <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. ad <hi>Gallos,</hi> p. 460.</note> to whom he made a preſent of it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came out, with the Addition of Teſtimonies: deſiring to be admoniſhed by him, if, in the midſt of much buſineſs, any thing had eſcaped him, which was leſs exactly ſpoken; while he ſtudied to ſerve the Chriſtian cauſe.</p>
            <p>To which He replies immediately, <q>That as he could not but eſteem it, a very great honour to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and beloved by the <hi>Coryphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of all Learning, both Sacred and profane; ſo he eſteemed this as a <hi>Golden Book,</hi> wherein <hi>Grotius</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:94132:11"/>
joyned Learning together with Piety: conſulting, that is, the Diſeaſe of the Age; to whoſe Palate, Piety (of it ſelf) had little ſavour. And, as for the immenſe collection of Teſtimonies then added, he made it appear by them, that in all his ſtudies the glory of Chriſt had alway been before his eyes: his holy diligence and induſtry having diſcovered ſo many, and ſuch things, which had eſcaped the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious eyes of others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And not long after he propounded ſome doubts, according to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and mentioned ſome exceptions, (as was noted before) which ſome, who had no good will to him, took at this <hi>Golden Book,</hi> as he again calls it: and notwithſtanding the harſh cenſures of ſome Learned Men, this excellent Perſon ſtill perſiſted in his high eſteem of the worth of this Author; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all unprejudiced Men would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look upon him with great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. So he tells <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> Five
<pb facs="tcp:94132:12"/>
Years after <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Claud. Sarrav.</hi> p. 146.</note> 
               <hi>(1645) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no,</hi> Grotius <hi>will alway be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great Man, by you and me; and by all that love Equity and Goodneſs: for he is full of envy, who denies due praiſes to ſuch a Hero.</hi> And a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hearing of the news of his death, he moſt ſadly bewails it, <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 171.</note> as the extinction of the bright Star of that Age; whoſe Name would be great as long as either Books or Learning were in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And while he had breath, he ſaith, he would glory in this, that he once had familiar acquaintance with a Man, who was <hi>re &amp; nomine Magnus,</hi> no leſs great indeed than his Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>This affection he ſeems to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him to his Grave, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his Memory at ſuch a rate, that in the Year <hi>1648.</hi> he ſtill ſays, he was proud of the Friendſhip of that Man;
<pb facs="tcp:94132:12"/>
by whom to have been known was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and who would be reverenced in all future Ages. In concluſion he calls him <hi>that Bleſſed Soul:</hi> even after he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had pronounced this ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Grotius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 196.</note>, that he favoured the Papiſts; and not only yielded too much to them in his later Writings; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed too much diſaffection to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in thoſe Countries. All this he candidly paſſed over with this cenſure <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 146.</note> 
               <hi>He is the beſt Man who hath few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faults; for there is no body to be found without ſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame favourable judgment; I ſuppoſe, all ſerious and conſidering men, will paſs upon him now; and not be hindred by any prejudices, which may have been taken up againſt him among our ſelves, from reaping that benefit which they may receive by reading this excellent Book. Which I preſent again to the view of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> World, and
<pb facs="tcp:94132:13"/>
have in a manner made a new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of it: the former, which came out near 50. Years ago, being ſo defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; that there were few Paragraphs in it, which ſtood not in need of ſome amendment, and in a great number the ſenſe was quite miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Who the Tranſlator was, I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; but it is certain, he either did not underſtand the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, or did not attend to what he was about, as appears by innumerable Inſtances. But one may ſuffice, in the <hi>Third Book, Sect. 3.</hi> where he Tranſlates <hi>altera Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi> the one Epiſtle of <hi>Peter.</hi> Beſides there is plain <hi>Arianiſm</hi> in his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>(Book V. Sect. 21.)</hi> for he ſays the Son was not uncreate as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is; when in <hi>Grotius</hi> the words are, the Son is not <hi>ingenitus</hi> unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the Father is.</p>
            <p>Yet where the Tranſlation was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I have let it go as it was; that I might not ſeem to be too curious a
<pb facs="tcp:94132:13"/>
Cenſurer of other Mens labours. And I have added ſuch paſſages as were not there; the Book it ſelf having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by <hi>Grotius,</hi> ſince that old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tranſlation. I know not how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it might be at that time, when it was firſt put into our Language; but now I think nothing can be more: And to make it of larger uſe, I have added alſo a <hi>Seventh Book</hi> of my own. In which, out of thoſe Principles chiefly, which <hi>Grotius</hi> builds upon in his <hi>Six Books,</hi> I have ſhown that <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> hath ſuffered very much by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that we need not go thither to be aſſured of the <hi>Truth</hi> of that Religion: but ſhall be better informed in our own Church by the Holy Scriptures, and ſuch works as theſe.</p>
            <p>I have not quoted all my Authors, no more than <hi>Grotius</hi> did in the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his Book. And it would have made the Work alſo too long (I thought) to Tranſlate his Teſtimonies, and add
<pb facs="tcp:94132:14"/>
the like of my own. Nor would it have been ſo uſeful to common Readers; who do but perplex themſelves in abundance of quotations, and muſt, after all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we report them truly: and therefore may as well believe us when we ſay; that they are ready at hand to atteſt every thing, which is here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from their Authority.</p>
            <p>Since the finiſhing of this little La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I was informed by a Friend, that Mr. <hi>Clement Barkſdale</hi> had tranſlated part of this Work into <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and upon ſearch, I found the three firſt Books among ſome other Diſcourſes, Printed 1669. And I am told further by another Friend, that he hath lately added (though I have not ſeen it) the three laſt Books. Which if I had known ſooner, it might have ſaved me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, moſt, if not all, of the pains I have taken. But I was perfectly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it; as I perceive he was of any former Tranſlation, before his. For in that Edition of his Diſcourſes, where
<pb facs="tcp:94132:14"/>
he hath added the <hi>Third</hi> Book of this Work, concerning the <hi>Authority of the Scriptures,</hi> he ſaith, it had not been till then in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will do no hurt, though the ſame good thing be reached out to us, by more hands than one: and ſo I leave it to Gods Bleſſing, upon the Readers ſerious peruſal.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are wont very often to ask me, who am ſenſible how highly you have deſerved of your Country, of learning, and (if you will permit me to add that) of me alſo; what the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of thoſe Books is, which I wrote in my own Country Language, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Chriſtian Religion. Nor do I wonder you ſhould make ſuch a queſtion; for you who have read, and that with ſo great judgment, all that is worth the reading; cannot be ignorant, what pains hath been already taken in this matter: by <hi>Raymundus Sebundus,</hi> with Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical ſubtilty; by <hi>Ludovicus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> with variety of Dialogues; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:94132:17"/>
by your <hi>Mornay,</hi> with no leſs Learning than Eloquence. For which cauſe it may ſeem more profitable to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate ſome of them, into the vulgar Tongue; than to begin a new Work upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>But what other men will judg of this matter I know not; my hope is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, <hi>Sir,</hi> who are ſo fair and eaſie a Judge, I may be abſolved, if I ſay; that having read not only thoſe Authors, but what the <hi>Jews</hi> have written for the old Judaical, and Chriſtians for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; I thought good alſo to uſe my own judgment, ſuch as it is, and to allow that freedom to my mind, which, when I wrote it, was denied to my body. For I thought that Truth was not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, but only with truth; and with ſuch truth alſo as I approved in my own mind: knowing it would be but a vain labour to go about to perſwade others of that, which I had not firſt perſwaded my ſelf to believe.</p>
            <p>Omitting therefore ſuch arguments, as ſeem'd to me to have little weight in
<pb facs="tcp:94132:17"/>
them; and the authority of ſuch Books, as I either knew or ſuſpected to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; I ſelected thoſe, both out of the ancient and modern times, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me to have the greateſt force in them. And what things I fully aſſented unto, thoſe I both caſt into an orderly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and expreſſed in as popular a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I could invent; and likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in verſe, that they might be the better committed to memory.</p>
            <p>For my intention was to do ſome good ſervice hereby to all my Country-men; eſpecially to ſea-faring men: that in their long Voyages, wherein they have nothing to do, they might lay out their time and imploy it; rather than, as too many do, loſe and miſpend it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, taking my riſe from the commendation of our Nation, which for diligent skill in Navigation much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the rest, I stirr'd them up to uſe this Art, as a Divine benefit: not meerly for their own gain, but for the propagation of the true, that is, the Chriſtian Religion. For they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:94132:18"/>
want matter for ſuch endeavours, when in their long Voyages they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly met, either with Pagans, as in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Guinea;</hi> or with <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> as under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, the <hi>Perſian</hi> and the <hi>Africans;</hi> or with <hi>Jews,</hi> who as they are now profeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſtians, ſo are diſperſed through the greateſt part of the World: and there would always be ſtore of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious men, who are ready upon occaſion to vent the Poiſon, which for fear they keep concealed. Againſt which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs I wiſht that our Country-men might be ſufficiently armed: and that they who are more ingenious than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confute Errours; and the rest would at leaſt be ſo cautious, as not to be overcome by them.</p>
            <p>And that I might ſhow Religion is no frivolous thing, I begin, in the firſt Book, at the ground or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; which is, that <hi>there is a God.</hi> Now that I attempt to prove after this manner.</p>

For ſince thoſe things which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Mans pleaſure and appointment, are neither the ſame among all Men, and are often ſubject to change; and yet there is no place where this notion is not found, and it is not changed by the alterations of times (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelf notes, who was not over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in ſuch matters) we muſt aſſign ſome cauſe of it, that extends it ſelf to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Which can be no other, than either an Oracle of God himſelf, or a Tradition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the firſt Parents of Mankind. The former of which if we admit, the thing in queſtion is granted; and if we affirm the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there can no good reaſon be given, why we ſhould believe thoſe firſt Parents did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94132:19"/>
a falſhood, to all their Poſterity, in a matter of the greateſt moment.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whether we conſider thoſe <hi>parts of the World</hi> which were anciently known, or thoſe that are lately found out, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is (as we have ſaid) any <hi>reliques</hi> of humanity, there certainly is <hi>this truth</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, as well by ſuch <hi>Heathens</hi> as have any ingenuity and wiſdom, as alſo by thoſe that are of a more dull and ſtupid diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The former whereof queſtionleſs could not all be deceived; neither is it likely that theſe later ſo ſilly and ſimple ſhould any way deviſe how to <hi>deceive</hi> one another.</p>
               <p>Neither let any Man here object, that there have been ſome in many Ages, who have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believed there is no God; or profeſſed they did not believe it: For both the ſmall number of them, and the Univerſal rejection of their opinion, as ſoon as their Arguments were underſtood; make it appear, that it did not proceed from the uſe of right reaſon, which is common to all Men; but either from the affectation of novelty (ſuch as was in him that would needs maintain the Snow to be black) or from a corrupt mind, like as Meats to a diſtempered Palate, taſte quite otherwiſe than indeed they are. Eſpecially ſince both Hiſtory and other Writings teach us, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94132:20"/>
the honeſter any man was, the more diligently did he preſerve the knowledge of God. And further, that this departure from ſo anciently a received opinion, chiefly proceeds from the naughty diſpoſition of thoſe, whoſe intereſt it is that there ſhould be no God; that is, no Judge of humane actions, appears even from hence: that whatſoever they put in the room thereof; whether a ſucceſſion of ſeveral kinds of things, without any beginning; or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of atomes; or any thing elſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; it hath not leſs, if not greater, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, nor is at all more credible (as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to any Man, that vouchſafes an ordinary attention to the matter) than that opinion which is already received.</p>
               <p>As for that which ſome pretend, that they cannot believe there is a God, becauſe they cannot ſee him; if they ſee any thing, they cannot but ſee how unworthy this thought is of a Man, who doth but believe that he hath a mind; which he never ſaw, no more than he doth the eſſence of God. Nor becauſe we cannot comprehend the Nature of God by our underſtanding, ought we therefore to deny there is any ſuch Nature: for this is proper to every inferior creature, not to be able to comprehend thoſe Beings which are ſuperior, and more excellent than it ſelf. The Beaſts cannot conceive what Man is, much leſs can they know after what manner Men inſtitute
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94132:20"/>
and govern Common-wealths, meaſure the Stars, and ſail upon the Sea; for all theſe things are out of their reach. From which very thing, Man, who is raiſed, and that not of himſelf, by the nobility of his nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Beaſts, ought to infer; that that being by whom he is made ſuperiour to Beaſts, is no leſs ſuperiour to him, than he himſelf to the Beaſts; and that therefore there is ſome Nature, which, as far more excellent, tranſcends his comprehenſion.</p>

               <p>Beſides, the multiplication of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things that are of the ſame nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>exuberancy</hi> and fruitfulneſs of the <hi>cauſes</hi> whence ſuch things more or leſs are generated: but of <hi>God</hi> there is neither beginning nor any <hi>cauſe.</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94132:23"/>
                  <hi>ſubſiſt,</hi> the ſame have the <hi>original</hi> of their <hi>being from God:</hi> for we have proved that that which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> of it ſelf, can be but <hi>one;</hi> whence we collect that all other things beſides this had their <hi>original</hi> from ſomewhat different from themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch things as have their <hi>beginning</hi> from another, we have ſeen before how that either in themſelves or in their cauſes, they proceeded from <hi>him</hi> which had no beginning, that is, <hi>from God.</hi>

               <p>Neither is this manifeſt by <hi>reaſon</hi> only, but alſo after ſome ſort by very ſenſe: for if we conſider the wonderful frame and faſhion of <hi>Man's body,</hi> both within and without, and how that each part and parcel thereof hath its <hi>proper uſe</hi> without the ſtudy or induſtry of his Parents, and yet with ſuch art that the moſt accompliſhed Philoſophers and Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could never ſufficiently admire it; this verily ſhows the Author of Nature to be a moſt excellent Mind: concerning which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Galen</hi> hath written well, eſpecially where he ſpeaks of the uſe of the <hi>eye,</hi> and of the <hi>hand.</hi> Yea more, the very bodies of mute <hi>beaſts</hi> do teſtifie the ſame: for their <hi>parts</hi> are not framed and compoſed by the power and vertue of the matter whereof they conſiſt, but by ſome ſuperiour and higher cauſe deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating them to a certain end.</p>
               <p>Neither is this plain by <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beaſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

and eſpecially in <hi>Bees,</hi> and likewiſe in other creatures, which before they make any trial do naturally eſchew ſuch things as are hurtful, and ſeek after ſuch things as are profitable for them.

               <p>In the next place conſider we the <hi>Stars</hi> of Heaven, and amongſt the reſt, as moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> both which for the making the earth fruitful, and preſerving living Creatures in their health and vigour, do ſo ſeaſonably perform their courſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a better cannot be deviſed.

               <p>Now as the earth is ordained for the uſe and benefit of living Creatures, ſo are all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial

things appointed chiefly for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of man, who by his wit and reaſon can ſubdue the moſt furious creature among them; whence the very <hi>Stoicks</hi> did collect, that the World was made for Man's ſake.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, ſince it exceeds the ſphere of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, to bring the heavenly bodies in ſubjection to him; neither is it to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they will ever ſubmit themſelves to man of their own accord; it follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is ſome <hi>ſuperior mind</hi> or <hi>ſpirit,</hi> by whole ſole appointment thoſe fair and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodies do perpetual ſervice unto man, though he be placed far below them; which <hi>ſame mind</hi> is no other than the framer of the ſtars, even the <hi>Maker</hi> of the whole World. Alſo the motions of theſe ſtars which are ſaid to be Excentrical and Epicyclical <hi>(i. e.</hi> in a Circle within the Orb of another Star) do plainly ſhew, not the power of matter, but the appointment of a free Agent. The ſame do the Poſitions of the Stars teſtifie, ſome in this part, others in the other part of Heaven: together with the ſo unequal form of the Earth, and of the Seas. Nor can we refer it to any thing elſe, that the Stars move this, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than another way. The moſt perfect form alſo and figure of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> roundneſs; as alſo the parts thereof, ſhut up as it were in the boſom of the Heavens, and diſpoſed with a marvellous order, do all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly

declare, that they were not tumbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or conjoyned as they are, <hi>by chance,</hi> but wiſely ordained by <hi>ſuch an underſtanding</hi> as is endued with ſuper-eminent excellency. For what Ninny is there ſo ſottiſh, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing ſo accurate and exact from chance?

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94132:32"/>
made of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> which ſome have intimated by the name of an Egg: alſo of the making of living creatures, and laſt of all of Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a <hi>Divine Image;</hi> and of Man's dominion over other creatures; all which may be read in ſundry Authors, and at laſt in <hi>Ovid,</hi> who tranſcribed them out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers. That all things were made by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> was confeſſed even by <hi>Epichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> and before them by a moſt ancient Writer (not of thoſe Hymns, which now go under that name, but) of thoſe Verſes which antiquity called <hi>Orphean verſes;</hi> not becauſe they had <hi>Orpheus</hi> for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but becauſe they ſummarily compriſed his Doctrine. <hi>Empedocles</hi> acknowledged that the Sun was not the <hi>primitive light,</hi> but a fit <hi>receptacle</hi> of light. <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> think that above the ſphere or orb of the ſtars there is a Divine habitation, wherein <hi>Homer</hi> imagined there was perpetual light.</p>
               <p>THAT of all things <hi>God</hi> was the moſt ancient, becauſe not begotten; the World moſt beautiful, becauſe the work of GOD: and that darkneſs was before the light, were all the doctrines of <hi>Thales</hi> out of the ancient Learning.

It was the opinion of <hi>Athenagoras</hi> that all things were ordered and diſpoſed by the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est intelligence;</hi> of <hi>Aratus,</hi> that the Stars were made by <hi>God;</hi> and after the <hi>Grecians,</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that life was infuſed into things by the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> and that Man was formed of <hi>Clay,</hi> is delivered by <hi>Heſiod, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Callimachus:</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that by the common conſent of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is agreed, there is but one Supreme <hi>God,</hi> which is the cauſe of all things.

               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> taught, that Man at the beginning led his life in all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, being <hi>naked</hi> in his body, and not aſhamed; whence came <hi>the Poets fiction of the golden age,</hi> which was famous even amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> relates: The Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the <hi>Tree,</hi> the <hi>Serpent</hi> was extant, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, among the Idolatrous <hi>Indians</hi> in his time: And that the

               </p>
               <p>NEITHER will it enter into the heart of any wiſe Man to think that <hi>Moſes,</hi> (having ſo many enemies both of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and of other Nations, as the <hi>Idumaeans, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians)</hi> would dare to divulge ought concerning the beginning of the World, and other ancient things, which either could be confuted by other more ancient Writings, or were repugnant to the common received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in thoſe times; neither doubtleſs would he publiſh any thing touching the affairs in that Age, which could be juſtly gainſaid or diſproved by the teſtimonies of any then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94132:35"/>
ſpeak much of the Law it ſelf, which was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Legal Rites. Both <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Justin</hi> out of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> give an excellent teſtimony of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> inſomuch that here (me thinks) 'tis needleſs to produce any further teſtimony of ſuch things as are found, or have anciently been found conſenting with the Books of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> touching <hi>Joſhua</hi> and others; ſeeing that whoſoever gives cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which to do no Man can without great impudency refuſe,) the ſame muſt needs confeſs, that there were indeed wonderful Miracles anciently wrought by God, which is the thing we here chiefly go about to declare.</p>
               <p>As for the Miracles of after Ages, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and others, there is the leſs reaſon to think them counterfeit; becauſe in thoſe times <hi>Judaea</hi> was both more known than formerly; and upon the account of diverſity of Religion, was extreamly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Neighbours. Who might have very eaſily blaſted the fame of ſuch Miracles, if they had been lies, as ſoon as it began to be ſpred abroad. The Hiſtory of <hi>Jonah,</hi> who lay three days in the Whale's belly, is to be read in <hi>Lycophron,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas Hazous;</hi> ſave only that in ſtead of <hi>Jonah,</hi> they have put the name of <hi>Hercules:</hi> whom they ſo much honoured, that to make him appear
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94132:35"/>
the more illuſtrious, they were wont (as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> and <hi>Servius,</hi> and others have noted) to report of him, whatſoever magnificent things they heard of in any other places.</p>
               <p>Certain it is that <hi>Julian,</hi> who was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as much as of Chriſtians, was forced, by the evidence of Hiſtory, to confeſs that ſuch Men lived amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as were inſpired with the holy Spirit of <hi>God;</hi> and that Fire deſcended from Heaven upon the Sacrifices of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> And verily 'tis well worth our obſervation, that amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> there were not only grievous puniſhments appointed for ſuch Men as did falſly aſſume to themſelves the <hi>Prophetical Function,</hi> but alſo many Kings and great Men, that might have by that means purchaſed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to themſelves, and likewiſe very many learned Men as was <hi>Eſdras</hi> and others, that never durſt arrogate to themſelves this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor any Man elſe, for divers Ages before the times of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. XVI.</hi> The ſame is proved by the Oracle and Predictions.</head>
               <p>BUT more unlikely it is, that ſo many Thouſand People ſhould be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the avouching of a perpetual and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prodigy, (as we may call it) to wit, the <hi>holy Oracle,</hi> which after a reſplendent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhined from the breſt-plate of the <hi>High-Priest:</hi> The truth whereof was ſo ſtrongly believed by all the <hi>Jews</hi> to have continued until the deſtruction of the firſt Temple, that out of all doubt, their Anceſtors had certain knowledge concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>Like to this from <hi>miracles,</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument as forcible and effectual to prove <hi>GOD's providence,</hi> taken from thoſe <hi>predictions of future events,</hi> which among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were many and manifeſt. Such was that prophecy of his being made Childleſs who ſhould attempt to re-edifie <hi>Jericho:</hi> and that of the overthrow of the Temple at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi> by a King, named <hi>Joſiah,</hi> foretold above Three Hundred Years before the thing came to paſs. So likewiſe the very name and chief acts of <hi>Cyrus</hi> foretold by <hi>Eſaiah:</hi> the event of <hi>Hieruſalems</hi> ſiege by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhown by <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> So alſo <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94132:36"/>
touching the tranſlation of the Empire of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> unto the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> then from them unto <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whoſe Empire ſhould afterward, in part, be divided among the Succeſſors of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Seleucus.</hi> And what evils alſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation ſhould ſuffer from all theſe, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes;</hi> which were ſo clearly foretold, that <hi>Porphyry</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with theſe Predictions, ſuch <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtories as were extant in his time, could no otherwiſe tell how to ſhift them off, than by ſaying that thoſe things which were <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> upon <hi>Daniel,</hi> were written after ſuch time as they came to paſs; which is all one, as if one ſhould deny that that was written in the time of <hi>Augustus</hi> which hath been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s name, and was always repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Virgil</hi>'s work. For there was never any more ſcruple made of the former amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> than of this latter amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe things we may add very many, and moſt famous Oracles among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru;</hi> which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the coming of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into thoſe Countreys, and the calamities which ſhould thereupon follow. And hither alſo may be referred, not a few dreams, ſo exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the events, which both in themſelves and in their cauſes, were wholly unknown to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94132:37"/>
them that dreamed; that they cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great immodeſty, be referred to chance, or to natural cauſes: of which kind <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> in his Book <hi>Of the Soul,</hi> hath collected illuſtrious examples, out of the moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authors. Spectres alſo or apparitions belong to this head, which have been not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, but heard to ſpeak: as thoſe Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans relate, who are the fartheſt from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious credulity; and is reported by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our own Age, who have lived in <hi>China,</hi> and in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and other parts of <hi>America.</hi> Nor are publick trials of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, by touching of red hot Plow-ſhares, to be deſpiſed: which the Hiſtories of ſo many <hi>German</hi> Nations, and the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have remembred.</p>

Such as (to ſay nothing now of the <hi>Jews) Sergius,</hi> Governor of <hi>Cyprus, Dionyſius Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opagita, Polycarpus, Juſtinus, Irenaeus, Athena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Origen, Tertullian, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> with divers others; who almoſt all being brought up in other religions, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hopes of any Wealth or Preferment by <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> yet became worſhippers of <hi>this Man</hi> that died ſo ignominious a death, and exhibited due honour to him as <hi>God:</hi> Of which no other reaſon can be given, but this alone; that they made diligent enquiry, as became prudent Men, in a matter of greateſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94132:44"/>
moment: and found that what was bruited abroad concerning the Miracles wrought by <hi>Christ,</hi> was true; and relied upon firm wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. As the curing, and that with his word only, and before all the People, divers grievous and inveterate Diſeaſes; the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sight to him that was born blind; the multiplying of a few Loaves, more than once, for the feeding many Thouſands, who could teſtifie the truth of it; the recalling of the Dead to Life again; and many more of the like kind. The report of which things had then ſuch a certain and undoubted origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; that neither <hi>Celſus,</hi> nor <hi>Julian,</hi> when they wrote againſt Chriſtians, durſt deny there were ſome Prodigies done by <hi>Christ;</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the Talmudical Books do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly confeſs it.</p>

               <p>THAT theſe wondrous Works were not wrought by any Natural Power, it is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94132:45"/>
manifeſt, by this very thing, that they are called <hi>wonders</hi> and <hi>miracles.</hi> Nor is it poſſible by the force of nature, that any grievous Diſeaſes and Infirmities ſhould be cured meerly by a Man's <hi>voice,</hi> or by the <hi>vertue</hi> of a <hi>Touch,</hi> and that even upon a ſuddain. And if ſuch Works could have any way been aſcribed to a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral efficacy, it would have been ſaid before now, either by thoſe that were profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> while he lived upon Earth, or by thoſe that have been Adverſaries of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſince his death.</p>
               <p>By the like Argument we may prove, that they were not jugling deluſions, becauſe they were done openly in the ſight of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: amongſt whom divers of the Learned ſort did malign and bear ill will unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not without envy obſerving all that he did. Add further, that the like Works were often iterated, and the effects thereof were not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory but permanent and durable. All which being duly pondered, it muſt needs follow (as the <hi>Jews</hi> have confeſſed) that theſe Works proceeded from a more than Natural or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power, that is, from ſome Spirit either good or evil. That they proceeded not from any <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> may be proved, becauſe that the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (for the confirmation whereof theſe Works were wrought) was quite oppoſite and contrary to bad <hi>Spirits.</hi> For it prohibits the worſhipping of <hi>evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94132:45"/>
and diſſwades Men from all uncleanneſs of affections and manners, wherein ſuch <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> are much delighted. And this is alſo plain, for that whereſoever the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was received and eſtabliſhed, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the downfal of the worſhip of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and of Magical Arts: and one God was worſhipped with a deteſtation of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; whoſe power and authority <hi>Porphyry</hi> acknowledges, was broken by the coming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it to be thought that any wicked <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſo ignorant and fooliſh, as to effect and often bring to paſs things that are cauſes of its own hurt and diſgrace, and no way conducing to its honour or benefit. Beſides it ſtands no way with the wiſdom or goodneſs of <hi>God</hi> himſelf to believe that he would ſuffer ſo harmleſs and innocent Men, ſuch as feared him, to be deceived by the <hi>deluſion</hi> of <hi>Devils:</hi> and ſuch were the firſt followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as is plain by their innocent life, and by the many calamities which they endured for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if thou affirmeſt that thoſe works of Chriſt proceeded from ſome <hi>good Spirits</hi> which are inferiour to <hi>God;</hi> in ſo ſaying thou doſt confeſs that the ſame works were well pleaſing unto <hi>God,</hi> and did tend to the honour of his name; foraſmuch as <hi>good Spirits</hi> do nothing but what is acceptable and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94132:46"/>
glorious unto <hi>God:</hi> To ſay nothing now of ſome of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s works, which were ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, that they ſeem to have <hi>God</hi> himſelf for the <hi>author</hi> of them, and could not have been done but by the immediate finger of an <hi>omnipotent power,</hi> as ſpecially, the reſtoring divers Perſons from Death unto Life again.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>God</hi> doth not produce any Miracle, nor ſuffer any ſuch Wonders to be wrought without juſt cauſe: For it becomes not a wiſe Maker of Laws to forſake and depart from his own <hi>Laws,</hi> unleſs upon ſome good and weighty reaſon: Now no other cauſe of theſe things can be given than that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, namely, that hereby his doctrine might be verified and confirmed. And doubtleſs they that were Spectators of his Works, could conceive no other reaſon thereof: amongſt which ſince there were (as was ſaid) many godly Men, piouſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly affected, it is horrible impiety to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that <hi>God</hi> did work theſe things only to delude and deceive them.

               <p>BEſides the Miracles that <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought to confirm his Doctrine, another like Argument may be taken from his wonderful <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to Life again, after that He was Crucified, Dead, and Buried.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all Ages and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries alledge the ſame, not only for a truth, but alſo as the moſt ſtrong ground and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt foundation of their <hi>Faith;</hi> which could not be, unleſs thoſe that firſt taught <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> did perſwade their Auditors that the thing was ſo for certain; And yet they could not induce any wiſe Man to the belief hereof, unleſs they could verily affirm, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were eye-witneſſes of this matter. For without ſuch an ocular teſtimony, no Man in his wits would have given credit unto them; eſpecially in ſuch times, when to believe them was to expoſe themſelves to the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and dangers. But that this was their conſtant aſſertion, both their own Books, and other Writings do teſtifie. For out of their Books it appears, that they appealed unto Five hundred Witneſſes that had beheld <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94132:47"/>
after he was riſen from the Dead. Now it is not the faſhion of lyars and diſſemblers to appeal to ſo great a number of Witneſſes: Neither could it poſſibly ſo fall out that ſo many Men ſhould agree and conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bear falſe witneſs. Or ſuppoſe there had been no other witneſſes, ſave thoſe twelve known <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the firſt publiſhers of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine,</hi> yet this had been ſufficient. No Man is wicked for nothing. And <hi>honour</hi> for their lying they could not expect, in regard that all kind of dignities and promotions were then in the hands of the <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> from whom they received nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ignominy. Neither could they hope for any <hi>Wealth</hi> and Riches, becauſe this profeſſion was oftentimes puniſhed with the loſs of goods and poſſeſſions: or if it was not; yet the <hi>Goſpel</hi> could not be taught by them, unleſs they omitted or neglected all care about worldly goods. Neither could the hope of any other <hi>worldly advantage</hi> move them to utter untruths; ſeeing that the very preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> did expoſe them to labours, hunger, thirſt, ſtripes, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>To get <hi>credit</hi> and reputation only among their own Country-men was not ſo much worth, that they poor ſimple Men, whoſe life and doctrine was abhorrent from all pride, ſhould therefore run upon ſo great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94132:47"/>
Neither again could they have any hope their doctrine would make ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as to win them any fame; being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both by the nature of Man, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to its own advantage, and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them, who then every where gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unleſs they had been ſome way animated and incouraged by the <hi>promiſe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we may add, that they had no reaſon to promiſe themſelves, that this fame, ſuch as it might prove, would be durable: ſince they expected (God on purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his counſel in this matter) the end of the whole World as nearly approaching; which both their own Writings, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thoſe Chriſtians that followed them, make moſt evident. It remains therefore that we ſay, if they did lye, it was for the defence of their Religion; which cannot with any reaſon be laid to their charge, if the thing be rightly conſidered. For either they did ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe that this <hi>Religion</hi> which they profeſſed was the <hi>true Religion,</hi> or elſe they were of a contrary mind. If they did not believe it to be <hi>true;</hi> nay if they thought not that it was abſolutely the beſt, they would never have made choice hereof, and refuſed other <hi>Religions</hi> far more ſafe and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Nay further, though they conceived it to be <hi>true,</hi> yet they would not have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, unleſs they had been fully perſwaded,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94132:48"/>
that the profeſſion thereof was <hi>neceſſary;</hi> ſpecially, for that they might have eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, and partly they could tell by experience what troops of Men would be expoſed to death for this <hi>profeſſion,</hi> which without juſt cauſe to occaſion was no better than plain rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery or murder.</p>
               <p>But if we ſay, they believed that this <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> was true, and the very beſt, and by all means to be profeſſed, and that after the death of their <hi>Lord and Master:</hi> ſurely, that could no way be ſo, if their Maſters promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Reſurrection had deceived them, and not proved true. For that had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make any Man in his wits disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, even that which he had already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>Moreover all Religions, and Chriſtianity more than any other, forbids lying in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe witneſs, eſpecially in divine things: wherefore they could not for the love of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and that ſuch a Religion, be induced to tell untruths. Beſides theſe Men were of an upright converſation; their life was ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unblameable even in the judgment of their adverſaries; who had nothing to object againſt them, ſave their ſimplicity, which of all other diſpoſitions is the moſt unlikely to forge a lye. Nay, there were none among theſe Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (whereof we ſpeak) who did not ſuffer grievous torments for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94132:48"/>
that <hi>Jeſus was riſen:</hi> and many of them were put unto moſt exquiſite pains of death for bearing teſtimony of the ſame. Now granting it to be poſſible, that a Man in his wits may be content to endure ſuch things, for ſome opinion which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and really believes in his mind; yet that for a falſhood, which he knows to be ſo, not only ſome one Man, but a great many Men, who are like to gain nothing at all by making that falſhood to be believed, ſhould conſent to ſuffer ſuch cruel torments, is a thing altogether incredible.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe were not Mad-men, both their converſation and their writings do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtifie. Likewiſe what is ſpoken of the firſt Apoſtles, may alſo be ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> who openly taught that he ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſitting in Heaven: who alſo was not inferiour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the <hi>Jewiſh Religion;</hi> nor might he have wanted dignities and preferments, if he would have followed the foot-ſteps of his <hi>Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary, by taking upon him the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he became liable to the hatred and malignity of his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, and ingaged himſelf to undertake dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, dangerous, and laborious travels tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the World; and laſt of all to undergo a diſgraceful death and torment.</p>

               <p>SUCH and ſo great teſtimonies no Man can diſprove or gainſay, unleſs ſome will reply, that the thing it ſelf is impoſſible to be done: for ſo are thoſe things which imply a contradiction, as they ſpeak. Howbeit that cannot be affirmed of this matter. It might indeed, if one could ſay that one and the ſelf ſame Man lived and died at the ſelf ſame time: But that a Man may be reſtored from death to life, eſpecially by the power and vertue of him who firſt gave life and being unto Man, I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould be accounted for a thing <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither hath it been thought <hi>impoſſible</hi> by wiſe Men; For <hi>Plato</hi> writes that this was done to <hi>Eris</hi> an <hi>Armenian.</hi> And the like is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a certain Woman by <hi>Heraclides</hi> a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher of <hi>Pontus,</hi> of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> by <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> and of another by <hi>Plutarch:</hi> all which, (whether true or falſe) do ſhew that in the opinion of learned and wiſe Men the thing was conceived to be poſſible.</p>

For it doth not conſiſt with the divine Juſtice and Wiſdom to honour Him after ſo excellent a manner; who had committed the crime of falſifying in ſo weighty a matter. Eſpecially conſidering that before his Death He had foretold to his Diſciples, both his Death, and the kind of it, and his Reſurrection to Life again: adding this withal, that theſe things ſhould therefore come to paſs, that they might teſtifie and confirm the truth of his Doctrine.</p>

               <p>FOR to begin with the reward that is at the end propounded to Man, which though it be the laſt in fruition and execution, yet is it the firſt in his intention: If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the inſtitution of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the plain or expreſs covenant of the <hi>Law,</hi> we ſhall find nothing there promiſed ſave the welfare and <hi>happineſs of this life:</hi> as namely, a fruitful Land, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Corn and Victual, victory over their Enemies, ſoundneſs of Body, length of Days, the comfortable bleſſing of a hopeful Iſſue, and ſurviving Poſterity, and the like. For if there be any thing beyond, it is involved in dark ſhadows, or muſt be collected by wiſe and difficult reaſoning: Which indeed was the cauſe why many (in particular the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,</hi> who profeſſed themſelves to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and obſervers of <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Law,)</hi> had no hope of enjoying any happineſs after this life.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who received their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94132:51"/>
learning from the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and had ſome hope in another World, after this life was ended; they ſpake thereof after a very doubtful manner; as appears by the diſputations of <hi>Socrates,</hi> by the Writings of <hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> and others. And the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they produce for it are grounded upon uncertainties; proving no more the happineſs of a <hi>Man</hi> than of a <hi>Beaſt:</hi> Which while ſome of them obſerved, it was no wonder if they imagined, that <hi>Souls</hi> were tranſlated and conveyed from Men to Beaſts, and again from Beaſts into Men.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this opinion was not confirmed by any teſtimonies, or grounded upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſon, (and yet it was undeniable that there is ſome end propoſed to Man's actions,) therefore others were induced to think, that <hi>vertue</hi> was the end or reward of Mens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and that a <hi>wiſe Man</hi> was happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, even though he were put into that tormenting braſen <hi>Bull</hi> made by <hi>Phalaris.</hi> Howbeit this fancy was juſtly diſtaſteful and improbable to another ſort, who ſaw well enough that Man's <hi>happineſs,</hi> eſpecially the higheſt, could not conſiſt in any thing that was accompanied with perils, troubles, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and death (unleſs we have a mind to follow the ſound of words without the ſenſe of things:) Wherefore they placed Man's <hi>chiefeſt happineſs</hi> and end in ſuch things as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94132:51"/>
were delightful and pleaſing to <hi>ſenſe.</hi> But yet this opinion alſo was diſproved and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confuted by many, as being prejudicial to all <hi>honeſty,</hi> the ſeeds whereof are rooted in our hearts by <hi>nature:</hi> as alſo becauſe it debaſes Man, who is advanced to a higher pitch, and throws him down into the rank of Beaſts; which ſtoop down and pore upon nothing, but what is on the Earth.</p>
               <p>With theſe and ſuch like uncertainties and doubtings was <hi>Mankind</hi> diſtracted at that time when <hi>Chriſt</hi> brought in the true knowledge of the <hi>right end:</hi> who promiſed unto his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after their departure hence, a life, not only without death, without ſorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but attended with the higheſt joy and <hi>happineſs:</hi> and that not of one part of Man alone, to wit, of his <hi>Soul,</hi> (the felicity whereof after this life, partly by probable conjecture, and partly from tradition, was hoped for before) but alſo of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> together. And this moſt juſtly; that the Body, which for the Divine Law, muſt often ſuffer grievances, torments and death, may not be without a recompence of <hi>reward.</hi> Now the reward and promiſed joys are not vile and baſe, as good chear and dainty fare, wherewith the more carnal ſort of <hi>Jews</hi> feed their hopes; or the embraces of beautiful Women, which the <hi>Turks</hi> expect to enjoy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death: for both theſe <hi>ſenſualities</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94132:52"/>
ever to be united and ſet together again? But this relies upon no reaſon. For ſince it is agreed among moſt Philoſophers, that howſoever things be changed, there remains ſtill the ſame matter, capable of divers Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or forms; who dare ſay, that either God doth not know in what places, though never ſo diſtant, the parts of that matter are, which belong to a humane Body; or, that He wants power to reduce them and ſet them together again; and do that in his Univerſe, which we ſee Chymiſts do in their Fornaces, and Veſſels, gather together and unite things of the ſame nature, though ſcattered and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? And that a thing alſo may return to the form of its original, though the ſpecies be never ſo much altered, we ſee an example in the nature of things; as in the Seeds of Plants and living Creatures.</p>
               <p>Neither is that knot impoſſible to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſed, which is tyed by many; concerning thoſe humane bodies which paſs into the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of wild Beaſts or Cattle; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fed with them, become again the food of Man. For we muſt know, that the greateſt <hi>portion</hi> of ſuch things as we eat is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into integral parts of our bodies; but either turned into excrements, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the body, as <hi>Fleam</hi> and <hi>Choler;</hi> yea, much of that which becomes our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is waſted away either by diſeaſes, or by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94132:53"/>
inward natural heat, or by the Air about us. All which being ſo; he that ſo carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards all kinds of bruit Beaſts, that none of them periſh, the ſame <hi>God</hi> with a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>providence</hi> can alſo provide for humane bodies, that ſo much of them as becomes the food of other Men ſhall no more be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of thoſe that eat them, than are <hi>poiſons</hi> or <hi>phyſical potions;</hi> and the rather, becauſe it is in a manner naturally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that humane fleſh was not intended for Man's food. Or ſuppoſe it were not ſo, but ſomething which hath made an acceſſion to the latter body muſt be taken from it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; this will not make it not to be the ſame body: for even in this life there happen grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter changes of particles, than this comes to. Yea, we ſee that a Butterfly is in a Worm; and the ſubſtance of Herbs or Wine in ſome very ſmall thing; from whence they may be reſtored to their former juſt magnitude. Surely, ſince both theſe and many other things may without any inconvenience be ſuppoſed, there is no reaſon that the reſtitution of a Body diſſolved ſhould be reckoned among impoſſible things: which learned Men, <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſter</hi> among the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> almoſt all the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and <hi>Theopompus</hi> among the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> believed not only might, but ſhould be.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XIII.</hi> The excellency of holy Precepts given for the worſhip of God.</head>
               <p>THE ſecond thing wherein <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> excels all others that are, or ever were, or can be imagined, is the great <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Laws and Precepts;</hi> both in thoſe things that appertain to the Worſhip of God, and in thoſe that concern other matters.</p>
               <p>The holy Offices of the <hi>Pagans</hi> throughout almoſt the whole World, (as <hi>Porphyry</hi> ſhows at large, and the Navigations of our times have diſcovered) were full of cruelty: For it was the uſage, in a manner every where, to appeaſe the Gods, even with the Sacrifice of Humane Blood. Which cuſtome neither the <hi>Greek</hi> learning, nor the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws took away; as appears by what we read concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victims made to <hi>Bacchus Omestes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and of a <hi>Greek</hi> Man and Woman, and a Man and Woman of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which were ſacrificed to <hi>Jupiter Latiaris</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> Thoſe moſt holy Myſteries alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ceres,</hi> or of <hi>Liber Pater,</hi> were as full as ever they could hold of filthineſs and obſcenity; as appeared when the ſecrets of this Religion were once laid open, and began
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94132:54"/>
to be divulged: of which <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> and others, have given us a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Thoſe <hi>Festival</hi> days alſo which were conſecrated to the honour of the <hi>Gods,</hi> were celebrated with ſuch ſpectacles, that grave <hi>Cato</hi> was aſhamed to be preſent at them. But in the <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> there was nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, nothing diſhoneſt or unlawful. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit leſt the People that were prone to <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> ſhould decline or fall back from the <hi>true Religion,</hi> it was loaded and burdened with many <hi>precepts</hi> concerning ſuch things as in themſelves were neither good nor evil; ſuch were the <hi>ſacrificing</hi> of Beaſts, the <hi>Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> an exact <hi>reſt</hi> from labour upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the prohibition of eating ſundry kind of <hi>meats;</hi> Some of which cuſtomes the <hi>Turks</hi> have borrowed from them; adding further a prohibition for drinking Wine.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> teacheth, that as <hi>God</hi> is a moſt <hi>pure Spirit;</hi> So is he to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with <hi>pureneſs</hi> of mind and <hi>Spirit,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch works as in their own nature without a <hi>precept</hi> are moſt laudable and honeſt. Thus the profeſſors thereof are not to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the fleſh, but their carnal <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>deſires;</hi> not to keep Holy day by a reſt from all kind of work whatſoever, but only from that which is unlawful. Nor are we to offer unto <hi>God</hi> the bloud and fat of Beaſts; but if need be, even our own bloud for the teſtimony of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94132:54"/>
the <hi>truth.</hi> And what bounty or liberality ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we beſtow upon poor and neceſſitous <hi>perſons,</hi> to look upon it as given to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We need not now abſtain from any kind of meat or drink, but may and ought to uſe them both with moderation, ſo that our health be not thereby impaired; ſometimes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſubduing our Bodies to our minds by <hi>faſting,</hi> that they thereby may be the better fitted and prepared for more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>devotion.</hi> But the chief point of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is every where apparent, lies in a pious confidence: by which being compoſed to a faithful obedience, we rely wholly upon God, and ſtedfaſtly believe the performance of his promiſes. Whence there ariſes a good Hope, and a true Love both of God and our Neighbours: which makes us obey his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, not in a baſe ſervile manner, for fear of puniſhment; but that we may pleaſe him, and have Him, out of his great goodneſs, our Father and Rewarder.</p>
               <p>Moreover we are taught to <hi>pray,</hi> not for riches or honours, or ſuch things as many times do hurt to thoſe that wiſh much for them: but firſt and chiefly that which tends to <hi>God's glory;</hi> then for our ſelves, ſo much of theſe periſhing things as nature deſires; leaving the reſt to Divine Providence: and ſatisfying our ſelves that all ſhall be well, which way ſoever things go. But for eternal
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94132:55"/>
things, it teaches us to pray with the moſt earneſt deſire; <hi>viz.</hi> for pardon of our ſins paſt, and the aſſiſtance of his Spirit in time to come; whereby being ſtrengthned againſt all terrors and allurements, we may conſtantly perſiſt in a pious courſe of life.</p>
               <p>This is the true <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> than which nothing can be invented more worthy of Almighty God.</p>

As for <hi>Mahumet</hi>'s <hi>Religion,</hi> being hatcht in Wars, it breaths no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Wars, and is propagated by Wars, and Hoſtility. Thus the Laws and Statutes of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> which among the <hi>Greeks</hi> were moſt applauded, even by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo; Aristotle</hi> notes, and blames them for it, were wholly directed to warlike force. And yet the ſame <hi>Aristotle</hi> maintains War againſt <hi>Barbarians</hi> to be natural: when, on the contrary, it is certain that Men were by nature made to friendſhip and ſociety. For what is more unjuſt and unequal, than for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94132:55"/>
ſingle Murders to be puniſht; but to vaunt and triumph in the ſlaughter of whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in a glorious exploit? And yet, that ſo much celebrated <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth, how did it come by ſuch a Name, but by Wars? which oft-times were manifeſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, as they themſelves confeſs thoſe were, againſt <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Cyprus.</hi> And truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as the beſt Hiſtorians have committed to memory, moſt Nations thought robberies and plunders, without the bounds of their own Country, to be no diſgrace at all to them. The exacting of revenge, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> make a piece of vertue: To behold Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>players cut and ſlaſh each other, was one of the publick recreations of the <hi>Pagans:</hi> And nothing more ordinary than to expoſe their Children.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> indeed there was a better Law, and more holy Diſcipline: but yet to a People of an impotent anger ſome things were connived at, and ſome things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged. As a violent ſeizure upon the <hi>ſeven</hi> Nations, who had deſerved it: with which not contented, they proſecuted all that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from them with a cruel hatred; the ſigns and marks of which yet remain, in the prayers which they conceive againſt us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94132:56"/>
any of their Kindred, was permitted by the Law it ſelf. Whereas the Law of Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to revenge any injury that is done us, either in words or deeds: leſt that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we condemn in others, we ſhould again allow by its imitation.

               <p>THE Conjunction of Man and Woman, whereby Mankind is propagated, is a thing moſt worthy of the care of Laws. Which part of them it is no wonder the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> neglected, when they told ſuch lewd ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Whoredomes and Adulteries of the Gods which they worſhipped. Nay, the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abominable uſe which one Man made of another, was defended by the example of their Gods. Into whoſe number, upon that account, <hi>Ganymedes</hi> was anciently put, and afterwards <hi>Antinous.</hi> Which flagitious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is now moſt frequent among the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94132:56"/>
and is thought lawful by the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> and other Nations. Yea, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of <hi>Greece</hi> ſeem to have made it their buſineſs, to find out an honeſt Name, for that moſt filthy thing.</p>
               <p>Among which <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, the moſt excellent commending community of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; what did they do elſe, but turn a whole City into one common Brothel-houſe? A moſt unworthy thing: for ſince there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome mute Animals a certain conjugal League or Covenant, how much more equal is it, that ſo holy a Creature as Man ſhould not be born of uncertain ſeed; with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of all thoſe mutual affections, which are naturally between Parents and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law indeed forbad all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but both allowed one Man to have more Wives; and gave the Husband alſo a right, for any cauſe, to put away his Wife. Which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> at this day uſe; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> anciently with ſuch licence, that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> even lent their Wives to other Men, to uſe for a time.</p>
               <p>But the moſt perfect Law of <hi>Christ</hi> pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates to the very roots of Vices: and holds him who only attempts upon the chaſtity of any Woman, or looks laſciviouſly upon her, to be guilty before GOD, the Judge and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94132:57"/>
Searcher of the Hearts, of that crime, which, though not acted yet, was deſired. And ſince all true friendſhip is perpetual and inſoluble, He would deſervedly have that to be ſuch, which, with the ſociety of minds, contains alſo a conjunction of Bodies. Which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, is moſt profitable alſo for the right education of thoſe Children, that are the fruit of that Conjunction. Among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſome few Nations were content with one Wife; as the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which the Chriſtians now follow; that the mind of the Wife being intirely given to the Husband, may be compenſated with an equal retribution: and the government of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may the better proceed under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one Ruler: and divers Mothers may not bring in diſcord among Children.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> indeed had no ſuch cuſtome; yet their <hi>Law,</hi> that it might ſute it ſelf in ſome meaſure, to the humour of that People, permitted them to take <hi>uſury</hi> of ſtrangers; amongſt other things promiſing the reward of riches to them that obſerved the <hi>Law.</hi>

Beſides, the exceſſive <hi>care</hi> both for getting and keeping riches is accompanied with a kind of bondage and anxiety, which ſpoils that very pleaſure, which is expected from riches. Whereas thoſe things that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is content withall, are both few and eaſily acquired, without much labour or charge: yet if <hi>God</hi> beſtow any <hi>overplus</hi> upon us, ſo that we have ſomewhat to ſpare, we are not commanded to caſt the ſame into the <hi>Sea,</hi> as ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> unadviſedly have done; neither muſt we keep it unprofitably, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh it out waſtfully; but rather therewith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94132:58"/>
we ought to ſupply the wants and exigencies of other Men, either by giving, or by lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>them</hi> that would borrow: as becomes thoſe that look upon themſelves not as <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> of the things they enjoy, but as <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> under <hi>God Almighty,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> of all: knowing alſo that a benefit well beſtowed is a treaſure full of good hope; which neither the wickedneſs of Thieves, nor the variety of caſualties can in the leaſt diminiſh.</p>
               <p>A rare example of which true and unfeigned <hi>liberality</hi> we find in the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſent relief as far as from <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> to the poor that lived in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> as if the whole World had been but one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. And here in the Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> this caution is added, that the hope of being paid again, or getting credit by it, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowre our bounty; whoſe beauty and grace is quite loſt with God, if it have reſpect to any thing but him. And that no Man may pretend for a cloak of his covetouſneſs, that he fears he may have need of all that he hath, when he grows old, or falls into any calamity; the Law promiſes a ſpecial care of ſuch Men as obſerve theſe Precepts. And to work in greater confidence in them, puts them in mind of the conſpicuous Providence of God in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wild Beaſts and Cattle; and in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Herbs and Flowres; and repreſents

withall what an unworthy thing it would be, if we ſhould not believe ſo Good and ſo Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a God: but deal with Him, as if He were a bad Creditor; whom we will not truſt any further, than while we have a Pawn or pledge in our hands for our ſecurity.</p>

For anſwer whereunto, we may obſerve that the like <hi>diverſity</hi> of opinions happens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all kind of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> to wit, partly through the weakneſs of humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and partly becauſe Man's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is hindred and intangled by his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Howbeit this variety of opinions is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within certain bounds and limits: for there are ſome <hi>common principles</hi> agreed upon by all, and whereupon they ground their doubts. Thus in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> 'tis queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>whether a circle may be made quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi> but not whether after the taking away of equal parts from equal, the reſidue will not remain equal. The ſame may be ſeen in <hi>natural Philoſophy,</hi> alſo in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and in other Diſciplines. In like manner the <hi>difference</hi> of opinions that is amongſt <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> doth not hinder the common conſent and agreement in thoſe <hi>fundamental principles,</hi> for which chiefly we have commended <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> the certainty whereof appears in this, namely that thoſe which out of mutual and deadly hatred ſought all the occaſion and matter of contention they could, durſt not for all that proceed ſo far, as to deny that theſe <hi>Precepts</hi> were commanded by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> no not even thoſe that refuſe to frame their lives and actions according to that rule.</p>
               <p>But if there be any Man that will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict theſe Principles, he is to be accounted

like to thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> that denied <hi>the Snow to be white:</hi> For as theſe are confuted by ſenſe, ſo are thoſe convinced by the unanimous conſent of all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, and of the Books which were written by the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and by thoſe next to the firſt, and by the Doctors which followed afterward; even thoſe that witneſſed their <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by their death.

                  <hi>SECT. XX.</hi> The excellency of Christian Religion is further proved from the dignity of the Author.</head>
               <p>THE third thing wherein we ſaid <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> excelled all others that are, or can be deviſed, was the <hi>manner</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was delivered and divulged. Where firſt we ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that were authors of the wiſdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94132:60"/>
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> confeſſed that they could not affirm almoſt any thing for certain in their <hi>doctrine,</hi> becauſe (quoth they) <hi>truth lies bid in a deep Pit;</hi> and our minds are no leſs <hi>dazeled</hi> in the contemplation of divine things, than the eyes of an Owl in beholding the bright ſhining of the <hi>Sun:</hi> Beſides, there was none among them but was notoriouſly guilty of <hi>ſome vice</hi> or other. For ſome were flatterers of <hi>Princes,</hi> others addicted to the impure love of Boys or Harlots; others gloried in a Dog-like impudence. And that they all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied one another, their ſcolding about words or matters of no moment is a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as this is of their coldneſs in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, that even they who believed one God, ſet him aſide, and not only worſhipped others, but ſuch as they knew were no <hi>Gods;</hi> making that only the <hi>rule</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi> which was commonly received and practiſed in publick. Touching <hi>the reward</hi> of <hi>godlineſs</hi> they determined nothing for certain, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the laſt (farewel) diſputation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> at his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Author of a Religion that is ſpred very far, his own Followers do not deny, to have been a Man that abandoned himſelf to luſt, throughout his whole life: But gave no aſſurance at all, by which Men may be ſatisfied, that there ſhall indeed be ſuch a reward as he promiſed; conſiſting in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94132:61"/>
banqueting and in venery; ſince they do not ſo much as pretend that his Body was raiſed to life again, but it lies buried at <hi>Medina</hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Moſes</hi> the Founder of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Law, though he was an excellent Perſon, yet he cannot be freed from all blame: ſince he could ſcarcely be perſwaded with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juctance to undertake the Embaſſy, which God charged him withal to the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> and expreſſed alſo ſome diſtruſt of <hi>God</hi>'s promiſe for bringing water out of the Rock, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themſelves confeſs. And he did ſcarce partake of any one of thoſe <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> which by the Law he made unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but was perplexed with continual muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſeditions in the Wilderneſs; neither was he permitted to enter into that bleſſed and pleaſant Land, ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Christ</hi> is deſcribed by his Diſciples, as a Perſon without all ſin; nor did others ever produce any teſtimony to prove that He was guilty of the leaſt: but whatſoever He preſcribed to others, He performed Himſelf. For there was nothing that God gave Him in charge, which He did not faithfully perform; being moſt ſimple and void of guile in his whole life; moſt patient of injuries, nay, of cruel torments, as He ſhowed in ſuffering even the puniſhment of the Croſs; moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and kind to all Men, even to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94132:61"/>
yea, thoſe Enemies who put Him to death: on whom he had ſuch compaſſion that he beſeeched God to forgive them.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>reward</hi> which he promiſed unto his Diſciples, it is both ſaid, and proved by undoubted arguments, that He himſelf is made partaker thereof after a moſt eminent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner. For after <hi>he</hi> was <hi>riſen</hi> from the dead, there were many that beheld, and heard, and handled, and felt <hi>Him:</hi> He alſo aſcended up into <hi>Heaven</hi> in the ſight of his <hi>Twelve Diſciples;</hi> where He obtained the higheſt <hi>power,</hi> as was evident in that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>promiſe</hi> made at his departure, he endued them that were his <hi>Followers</hi> with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſpeak thoſe Languages which they had never learnt, and with other wonder-working Powers: which will not let us doubt, either of his faithfulneſs, nor of his Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us the reward which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. And thus we have ſhown how that this <hi>Religion</hi> is more excellent than others, in regard that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Author of it hath <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> performed what he commanded; as alſo in his <hi>own perſon</hi> obtained, and already enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>happineſs</hi> that he promiſed.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XXI.</hi> Alſo from the wonderful ſpreading of this Religion.</head>
               <p>LET us in the next place deſcend to the <hi>effects</hi> of this <hi>doctrine</hi> brought by him to the World: which, if they be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will appear to be ſuch, that if God have any care of humane affairs, this doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be believed to be Divine. It was very agreeable to Divine Providence, to make that which was beſt, to be of the greateſt and largeſt extent. Now ſuch was the ſucceſs of the Chriſtian Religion; which we ſee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and taught through all <hi>Europe,</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the moſt Northern Provinces: and no leſs through all <hi>Aſia,</hi> even the Iſlands of it in the Sea: through <hi>Egypt</hi> alſo and <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi> and ſome other parts of <hi>Africa:</hi> And laſtly, through <hi>America.</hi> Nor is this only done now, but was ſo anciently, as is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of all times, by the Books of <hi>Christians,</hi> the acts of <hi>Synods,</hi> and by that old Tradition at this day preſerved among the <hi>Barbarians</hi> concerning the Travels and Miracles of <hi>Thomas, Andrew,</hi> and other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Clemens, Tertullian,</hi> and ſome <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> beſides, have noted how far the <hi>name</hi> of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94132:62"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> was known amongſt the <hi>Britains, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and other moſt remote Nations in their times. And certainly there is no other <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> comparable hereunto for ample and large extent. <hi>Paganiſme</hi> indeed is one name, but cannot be ſaid to be <hi>one Religion;</hi> ſince that it was neither agreed upon by the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> thereof what <hi>one thing</hi> they ſhould <hi>worſhip;</hi> but ſome adored the <hi>Stars,</hi> others the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and a third ſort reverenced their <hi>Cattel,</hi> others ſuch things as have no <hi>ſubſiſtence:</hi> Nor was this worſhip performed by vertue of the ſame Law, nor from any common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed are diſperſed and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down, yet remain one <hi>people.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit their <hi>Religion</hi> had never any notable growth or increaſe after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion: and their <hi>Law</hi> was not ſo much made known by them, as by <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for <hi>Mahumetaniſme,</hi> it is poſſeſſed of Land enough, but 'tis not alone: for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> is alſo profeſſed in the ſame Countries; where, in ſome places there are greater numbers of Chriſtians than of <hi>Turks:</hi> who, on the contrary, are not to be found at all, in moſt parts where Chriſtianity is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XXII.</hi> Conſidering the meekneſs and ſimplicity of them that firſt taught this Religion.</head>
               <p>IT follows that we conſider by what means this <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> had its augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe, that <hi>therein</hi> it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, and preferred before others. We ſee it commonly true of moſt Men, that they will eaſily follow the <hi>examples</hi> of Kings and Potentates what way ſoever they go; ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if <hi>Law</hi> and Penalties compel them to it. Hereby were the <hi>Religions</hi> of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and of <hi>Mahumet</hi> propagated. But <hi>they</hi> that firſt taught the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> not only wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all civil power and authority, but were of <hi>mean</hi> condition, no better than poor Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Weavers, and the like. Yet by ſuch Mens pains and induſtry, <hi>that doctrine,</hi> within the ſpace of Thirty Years, or thereabouts, was publiſhed not only thorowout all the parts of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> but alſo among the <hi>Parthians</hi> and remote <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it thus only in the beginning; but for almoſt <hi>three</hi> whole Ages together, this Religion was ſo promoted by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of private Men; without any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; without any worldly thing to invite
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94132:63"/>
Men to it; yea, againſt the will and the moſt violent oppoſition of thoſe who then had the Imperial Power; that before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> profeſſed Chriſtianity, this was become, very near, the greateſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> World.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> that taught morality, divers there were that commended themſelves alſo very much by their skill in other Arts. As the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> were famous for the ſtudy of <hi>Geometry,</hi> the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> for the Hiſtory of <hi>Plants</hi> and living Creatures, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> for <hi>Logical</hi> ſubtilty, the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> for knowledge of <hi>numbers</hi> and <hi>harmony:</hi> many alſo were admirable for <hi>eloquence,</hi> as <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus.</hi> But the firſt <hi>Doctors</hi> and Teachers of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with no ſuch <hi>art,</hi> but uſed the plaineſt <hi>language,</hi> without inticing words; only after a bare manner or naked form of ſpeech <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing</hi> their precepts, promiſes, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. Which having no efficacy in themſelves proportionable to ſuch a progreſs as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity made, we muſt needs confeſs, it was either attended by Miracles, or by <hi>God</hi>'s ſecret <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> aſſiſting the buſineſs, or <hi>both</hi> together.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XXIII.</hi> What great impediments there were that might terrifie Men from the embracing or the profeſſing hereof.</head>
               <p>HEreunto may be added another thing conſiderable, namely, that they who received Chriſtianity from thoſe Teachers had not their minds void of a certain form and rule of Religion; and ſo were not by that means ductile and eaſie to be drawn, as they were who firſt received the <hi>Paganiſh</hi> worſhip and <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Law: much leſs was their minds prepared for it, by ſome antecedent inſtitution; as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> by Circumciſion, and the knowledge of one God, were made fit to accept the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But quite contrary were filled with Opinions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, which are a kind of another nature, repugnant to thoſe new Inſtitutions; being educated, <hi>viz.</hi> and confirmed by the authority of Laws and of their Parents, in the <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Religion, or the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there was another <hi>impediment,</hi> to wit, the moſt grievous evils, which they who undertook Chriſtianity, muſt expect to ſuffer, or had reaſon to fear, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For ſeeing that humane nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94132:64"/>
ſuch <hi>evils,</hi> it muſt needs follow that the <hi>cauſes</hi> of thoſe <hi>evils</hi> cannot be admitted of without much difficulty. A long time were the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> deprived of all honours and dignities; and likewiſe much afflicted with divers penalties, with confiſcation of goods and baniſhments: which notwithſtanding were all but <hi>flea-bitings,</hi> for they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dig in the Mines; and to ſuffer torments, than which more cruel could not be deviſed.</p>
               <p>And ſuch multitudes of them were put to death, that there never was a greater number of Men at one time ſwept away and devoured, either by <hi>famine,</hi> or <hi>peſtilence,</hi> or <hi>war,</hi> as the <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of thoſe times do teſtifie. Their manner and kind of death alſo was not <hi>ordinary,</hi> but ſome were buried alive; others crucified; others endured puniſhments of the like kind, which cannot be read or thought of without the greateſt horror: and yet this ſavage cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which continued without much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (and that not every where) till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> World, and in other places endured longer; was ſo far from diminiſhing the number of Chriſtians; that quite contrary, their Blood might be called the Seed of the Church: there ſprang up ſtill ſo many, in the room of thoſe that were cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94132:65"/>
Now let us herein alſo compare other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions with Chriſtianity. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who are wont to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their own things above meaſure; yet give us in but a very ſhort Catalogue of ſuch as ſuffered death for the ſake of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Some <hi>Gymnoſophiſts, Socrates,</hi> not many more, are all they can number. And in thoſe eminent Men, it can ſcarce be denied, but that there might be ſome deſire of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their fame to Poſterity, which had a hand in the buſineſs. But amongſt thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that ſuffered <hi>martyrdom</hi> for their <hi>faith,</hi> there were very many of mean rank, of the common ſort of People, ſuch as were ſcarce ever taken notice of, or known to their Neighbours that lived hard by them. There were Women alſo, Virgins, and young Men; ſuch as had no deſire, nor any probable hope of getting renown in future times by their ſufferings: According as in the Books of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> we find the Names but of a <hi>few</hi> in compariſon of the whole <hi>number</hi> of thoſe that were put to death, who are only regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred <hi>in groſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we muſt add, that by a ſmall compliance and ſimulation, ſuppoſe by caſting a little Frankincenſe upon the Altar, moſt of them might have freed themſelves from ſuch puniſhments. Which cannot be ſaid of thoſe Philoſophers; who, whatſoever they might
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94132:65"/>
think ſecretly in their hearts, in all their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent actions, conform'd themſelves to the vulgar cuſtomes. So that, to have ſuffered death for the honour of God, cannot well be attributed to any other, but only the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians. And not to the <hi>Jews</hi> neither, after the times of <hi>Christ;</hi> nor before them, but to a few, if they be compared with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. More of which ſuffered for the Law of <hi>Christ</hi> in ſome one Province; than the <hi>Jews</hi> ever did; whoſe patience in this kind, may all very near be reduced to the times of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing Chriſtian Religion in this particular alſo ſo vaſtly excels all other, it ought juſtly to be preferred before them. And from ſuch a multitude of all kinds, and ſexes of People, diſtinguiſhed by ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places and ages, as did not ſtick to dye for this Religion; we may well gather, there was very great cauſe of ſuch conſtancy: which cannot be imagined to be any other; but the Light of Truth, and the Spirit of GOD.</p>

               <p>FInally, if any yet be not ſatisfied with theſe <hi>arguments</hi> aboveſaid, but deſire more forcible <hi>reaſons</hi> for confirmation of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion;</hi> let ſuch know, that according as things are divers, they muſt alſo have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Proofs. Thus is there one way in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> another in <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> a third in matters of advice and counſel, and laſtly another kind, when a <hi>matter of fact</hi> is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: wherein verily we muſt reſt content when the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> are free from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of untruth. Otherwiſe down goes not only all the uſe of <hi>hiſtory,</hi> and a great part of the <hi>art</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> but all the piety alſo that ought to be between Parents and Children, which cannot be known other ways. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the pleaſure of <hi>Almighty God</hi> that thoſe things which he would have us to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> (ſo that the very belief thereof may be imputed to us for obedience) ſhould not ſo evidently <hi>appear,</hi> as thoſe things which are apprehended by <hi>ſenſe</hi> and plain <hi>demonſtration;</hi> but only be ſo far forth <hi>revealed</hi> as may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>faith,</hi> and a perſwaſion thereof in the

hearts and minds of ſuch as are not <hi>obstinate:</hi> That ſo the Word of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> may be as a <hi>touchſtone,</hi> whereby Mens diſpoſitions may be tried whether they be curable or not. For ſeeing theſe <hi>arguments,</hi> whereof we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, have induced ſo many honeſt, godly, and wiſe Men to approve of this <hi>Religion,</hi> it is thereby plain enough that the fault of other Mens <hi>infidelity</hi> is not for want of ſufficient <hi>teſtimony,</hi> but becauſe they would not have <hi>that</hi> to be had and embraced for <hi>truth,</hi> which is contrary to their affections and deſires: It being, that is, an hard matter for them to make no great account of honours, and other worldly advantages; which they muſt do, if they receive what Chriſt hath taught, and ſo become ingaged to obſerve his Precepts. Which is diſcovered to be true by this very thing; that they take many other Hiſtorical Narrations to be true; which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appear to be ſo meerly by authority: and not by any ſuch foot-ſteps of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at this day, as the Hiſtory of <hi>Christ</hi> hath; partly in the confeſſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are now in being; and partly in thoſe things, which are every where found in the Aſſemblies of Chriſtian People; of which it muſt needs be granted there was ſome cauſe.</p>

Such, for inſtance, as out of hatred of the <hi>Jews</hi> reviled their <hi>God,</hi> the Maker of the World; and the <hi>Law</hi> which he had given them: or on the other ſide, ſuch as for fear of the evils which Chriſtians were to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, choſe to lurk and lye hid under the name of <hi>Jews;</hi> who had liberty, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to profeſs their Religion. But theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Men were renounced, in thoſe times, by all other Chriſtians throughout the World: when as yet all that differed in their opinions, with the ſafety of piety, were tolerated, by the order of the Apoſtles, with great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As for the former kind of theſe adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate <hi>Christians,</hi> I think they have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confuted, both by that which we have ſaid before, when we proved that <hi>there was but one only true God,</hi> the ſole framer of the whole World; As alſo by thoſe very <hi>Books,</hi> which that they might have ſome ſemblance of

If then it be true that he wrought <hi>wonders,</hi> why may we not believe him concerning his <hi>Heavenly Viſions,</hi> and <hi>inſtruction</hi> received from <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf? to whom if he was ſo dear, it cannot be that he ſhould teach any thing inglorious or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>falſities</hi> or untruths would have been. And as touching that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which is the only thing whereof they accuſe him, namely his <hi>doctrine</hi> of the liberty and freedom which was purchaſed for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> from thoſe Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that were formerly commanded them by <hi>MOSES;</hi> He had no reaſon at all to teach it, but only the truth of the thing which he aſſerted. For he himſelf was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94132:75"/>
both circumciſed, and did alſo of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord obſerve very many things which the Law enjoyned. And then for the ſake of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, he both did more difficult and ſuffered harder things than the Law required, or could be expected upon the account of the Law; and taught alſo his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to do and ſuffer the like. Whence it appears that he uttered no flattering or enticing ſpeeches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>auditors;</hi> who were taught in ſtead of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to keep every <hi>day holy</hi> for divine <hi>worſhip,</hi> and in ſtead of the little expences which the <hi>Law</hi> required to ſuffer the loſs of all their goods, and in ſtead of the <hi>bloud</hi> of Beaſts, to conſecrate their own <hi>bloud</hi> unto <hi>God.</hi> And further, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that <hi>Peter, John,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> in token of their conſent with him, gave him the <hi>right hands</hi> of fellowſhip: which he never durſt have ſpoken, if it had not been true, becauſe the ſame Men being then alive might have <hi>convicted</hi> him for a lyar.</p>

And then all thoſe things which were ſhown in the firſt Book to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to right reaſon; for inſtance, <hi>that there is one God,</hi> who alone is abſolutely <hi>perfect, infinite</hi> in virtue, life, wiſdom, and goodneſs, of whom all things that have any being were <hi>made:</hi> whoſe care and providence reacheth over all his works, eſpecially unto Men; and who can after this life bountifully reward all them that obey him: and that we ought to bridle our ſenſual appetites: that amongſt Men there is <hi>kinred</hi> and alliance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to love one another with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection: All theſe you ſhall find moſt plainly delivered in theſe Books. But to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert any thing for certain beyond theſe, either about the nature of God, or about his will, by the mere conduct of humane reaſon, the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94132:77"/>
contrary reſolutions, not only of the Schools among themſelves, but of particular Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, may teach us how unſafe and fallacious it is.</p>
               <p>And it is no marvel: for if Men do ſo far diſagree in their opinions, when they diſpute about the nature of their own <hi>Soul,</hi> then they muſt needs much more diſſent, when they go about to determine any thing not revealed concerning the <hi>higheſt mind,</hi> and the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>Spirit</hi> which ſo far tranſcends our weak apprehenſion. If (as prudent Men are wont to ſay) to enquire into the <hi>Counſels</hi> of Kings be <hi>dangerous,</hi> and not to be attempted or <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> by us; who then is there ſo ſagacious, that he ſhould hope to be able by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to find out what God's will is in thoſe things, which he may will freely as he pleaſes? Wherefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid very well, that none of theſe hidden <hi>myſteries</hi> could be known without an <hi>Oracle.</hi> Now there can no <hi>Oracle</hi> be proved to be an <hi>Oracle</hi> indeed by any clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>teſtimonies</hi> than thoſe that are contained in the ſaid <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>new covenant.</hi> It is ſo far from being proved, that it is not ſo much as aſſerted, that God did ever reveal any thing to Men concerning his <hi>nature,</hi> which was repugnant to theſe Books: nor can there any later ſignification of his <hi>will,</hi> which is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, be produced.

               <p>THERE are thoſe who are wont further to object againſt theſe Books, that there is ſometime a certain diſagreement in their ſenſe. But, quite contrary, whoſoever will judge of this matter with an indifferent mind, ſhall find this alſo may be added to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the authority of theſe Books, that they do moſt manifeſtly and apparently <hi>agree</hi> about ſuch things as concern any weighty point of <hi>doctrine</hi> or <hi>hiſtory:</hi> Which <hi>conſent</hi> and accord cannot elſe-where be found among any other <hi>Writers</hi> that are of one and the ſame <hi>ſect</hi> or <hi>profeſſion,</hi> whether we conſider the <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Greek Philoſophers,</hi> the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or the <hi>Roman Lawyers.</hi> All which do not only <hi>differ</hi> much among themſelves, yea even thoſe that are of the ſame <hi>ſect,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi>

and <hi>Xenophon;</hi> but oftentimes one ſhall find the ſame <hi>Writer</hi> to affirm now one thing, then another, as if he were <hi>forgetful</hi> of himſelf, or knew not what to reſolve upon. But theſe <hi>Writers,</hi> of whom we ſpeak, do inculcate and expreſs the ſame points of <hi>faith;</hi> they deliver the ſame <hi>Commandments;</hi> and as for their <hi>narration</hi> of the life, and death, and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Sum and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in them all is the very ſame.</p>
               <p>As touching ſome ſmall circumſtances, which make nothing to the main matter, they might happily have admitted a very eaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; though we now do not know it, becauſe of the likeneſs of things done at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, the ambiguity of names, or more names than one of the ſame Man or place, and ſuch like things.

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:94132:79"/>

               <p>THERE remains another way of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing a Teſtimony, which is by producing contrary Teſtimonies out of other Authors.</p>
               <p>But I dare boldly ſay, that there are no ſuch <hi>teſtimonies</hi> to be found, unleſs a Man will produce the <hi>ſayings</hi> of them that were <hi>born</hi> a long time after, and of ſuch alſo as did ſo openly profeſs <hi>enmity</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that they could be no fit <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in this matter.</p>
               <p>Nay, on the contrary, if need were, we could alledge many <hi>teſtimonies</hi> to confirm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of the <hi>hiſtory</hi> which is delivered in the ſaid <hi>Books.</hi> Thus both <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> report that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was crucified, and that ſundry <hi>miracles</hi> were done by him and his

                  <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Thoſe moſt famous Books of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> which were ſet forth about Forty Years after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion, do make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Herod, Pilat, Feſtus, Felix, John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Gamaliel,</hi> and of the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> at large.

               <p>NOW what can be farther objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Books, I ſee not, unleſs it be ſaid that they remained not altogether <hi>the ſame</hi> that they were from the beginning. And indeed it muſt be granted that what is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94132:80"/>
                  <hi>common</hi> to other Books might happen, nay did happen to <hi>thoſe;</hi> namely, that by the careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the perverſe care of the <hi>Tranſcribers,</hi> ſome Letters, ſyllables or words might be changed, left out, or added. But it is an <hi>unjuſt thing</hi> to bring in queſtion the <hi>truth</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>evidence</hi> only, becauſe in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ages</hi> there could not but be great variety of <hi>Copies,</hi> ſince both cuſtome and reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that what appears in the moſt and moſt ancient Copies, be preferred to the reſt. But that either by fraud or any other way, all the Copies were corrupted, and that in point of doctrine, or ſome remarkable piece of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will never be proved: for there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any evidences, nor any witneſſes of thoſe times, which atteſt it. But if, as was ſaid before, there be any thing urged, in much later times, by thoſe who bare an implacable hatred to the Diſciples of theſe Books; that ought to be lookt upon as a Reproach, not as a Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>And this truly, which we have ſaid, may be well thought a ſufficient Anſwer to thoſe, who object a change in the Scripture; for he who affirms that, eſpecially againſt a writing which hath been long, and in abundance of places, received, ought himſelf to prove his charge. But to make the vanity of this Objection more fully appear, we will ſhow, that what they feign, neither was, nor could be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:94132:80"/>
We have proved before, that the Books were written by the Authors whoſe Names they bear: which being granted, it follows that other Books were not foiſted into their room, nor was any notable part of them changed. For ſince that change muſt needs have ſome deſign, that part would notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly differ from the other parts and Books, which were not changed: which cannot now any where be diſcerned; nay, there is an admirable agreement, as we ſaid, in their Senſes.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as ſoon as any of the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical Men publiſhed any thing; there is no doubt to be made, but Chriſtians with great diligence (as became their piety, and care to preſerve and propagate truth to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity) took from thence many Copies for their uſe. Which therefore were diſperſed, as far as the Chriſtian Name; through <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which Places the <hi>Greek</hi> Language was ſpoken.</p>
               <p>And more than this, the Original Copies alſo, as we ſaid before, were preſerved till Two Hundred Years after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now it was not poſſible that any Book diffuſed into ſo many Copies, and kept not only by the private diligence of particular Perſons, but the common care of the Churches; ſhould be altered by the hand of any falſifier. Add further, that theſe <hi>Books</hi> in the following ages
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94132:81"/>
were tranſlated into the <hi>Syriac, Ethiopick, Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues: which <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are yet extant; and do not differ in any thing of moment from the <hi>Greek Copies</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we have the <hi>Writings</hi> of thoſe Men, who were taught by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, or by their <hi>Diſciples,</hi> wherein many places are cited out of theſe <hi>Books</hi> to the ſame ſenſe and meaning, which now we read them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any in the <hi>Church</hi> of ſo great <hi>authority</hi> in thoſe times, as to have met with obedience, if he would have changed any thing: As is plain enough by the free and open diſſent of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> from thoſe that were moſt eminent in the <hi>Church.</hi> After which times there ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many <hi>other men,</hi> of great Learning and Judgment, who having firſt made diligent inquiry thereof, received theſe <hi>Books,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their <hi>original</hi> purity. Hitherto alſo may be referred what but now we ſaid of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>ſects</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> all which, at leaſt ſuch as acknowledged, God to be the Maker of the World, and Chriſt to be the Author of a new Law, did receive and uſe theſe <hi>Books</hi> accordingly as we do the ſame. And if any had attempted to <hi>alter,</hi> or put any thing new into any part thereof, they ſhould have been accuſed by the reſt for <hi>forgery</hi> and <hi>falſe-dealing</hi> therein. Neither was there ever
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94132:81"/>
any <hi>Sect</hi> that had the liberty at their pleaſure to <hi>alter</hi> any of theſe <hi>Books</hi> for their own turns; For it is manifeſt that all of them did draw their <hi>arguments</hi> one againſt another, out of the ſame. And as for that which we touched concerning <hi>divine providence,</hi> it belongs no leſs unto the <hi>chiefeſt parts,</hi> than unto the <hi>whole Books;</hi> namely, that it is not agreeable to it, that <hi>GOD</hi> ſhould ſuffer ſo many <hi>Thouſand Men,</hi> which ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be <hi>godly,</hi> and earneſtly ſought after <hi>eternal life,</hi> to be led headlong into that <hi>error</hi> which they could no way <hi>avoid.</hi> And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken for the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>new covenant,</hi> whence alone, if there were no other helps, we might be ſufficiently inſtructed concerning the <hi>true Religion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Authors</hi> were either <hi>Prophets,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>credible men,</hi> ſuch as was <hi>Eſdras,</hi> who is thought to have collected the <hi>Books</hi> of the Old <hi>Testament</hi> into one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, during the life time of the Prophet <hi>Haggai, Malachy,</hi> and <hi>Zachary.</hi> I will not here repeat again what is ſaid before in the <hi>commendation</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Both that part of <hi>history,</hi> which at firſt was delivered by <hi>him,</hi> as we have ſhown in the firſt <hi>Book;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> alſo which was collected after his time is witneſſed even by many of the <hi>Heathen.</hi> Thus the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> have recorded the names of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and their <hi>Leagues</hi> with the Men of <hi>Tyre.</hi> Aſwel <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſus</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, makes mention of <hi>Nobuchadonoſor,</hi> and of other <hi>Chaldean</hi> Kings. He whom <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls <hi>Vaphres</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is termed <hi>Apries</hi> by <hi>Herodotus.</hi> In like manner the Books of the <hi>Grecians</hi> are repleniſhed with Narrations concerning <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his Succeſſors, until the times of <hi>Darius.</hi> And many other things concerning the <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> are related by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Books againſt <hi>Appion:</hi> whereunto we may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94132:82"/>
add what before we have touched out of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> and <hi>Trogus.</hi> But as for us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we cannot in the leaſt doubt of the truth of theſe Books, out of every one of which almoſt, there are teſtimonies extant in our Books, which are found likewiſe in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we find, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> reprehended ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> of his time, that ever he accuſed them of <hi>forgery</hi> committed againſt the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>Prophets;</hi> or that they uſed counterfeit Books, or ſuch as were changed.</p>
               <p>Then after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time, it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, neither is it credible that the <hi>Scripture</hi> was corrupted in matters of any moment; if we conſider rightly how far and wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the face of the earth, the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was ſpread, who every where were the keepers of theſe Books. For firſt of all, the Ten Tribes were led away captive by the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> into <hi>Media,</hi> then afterward the two other Tribes: And many of theſe alſo, after <hi>Cyrus</hi> granted them liberty to return, ſetled themſelves in foreign Countries. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> invited them with great <hi>promiſes</hi> to come into <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The cruelty of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> the civil Wars of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> together with thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Soſſius</hi> from without, did diſperſe and ſcatter abroad many of them. The parts of <hi>Africa</hi> about
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94132:83"/>
                  <hi>Cyrene</hi> were full of the <hi>Jews:</hi> ſo were the Cities of <hi>Aſia, Macedonia, Lycaonia;</hi> and likewiſe the Iſles of <hi>Cyprus, Crete,</hi> and others. Alſo what a number of them there was at <hi>Rome,</hi> may be learned out of <hi>Horace, Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Martial.</hi> Now it is not poſſible that ſuch Multitudes ſo far diſtant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould be <hi>cozened</hi> in this kind; neither could they ever accord all in the coining of an <hi>untruth.</hi> Add moreover, that almoſt Three Hundred Years before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and care of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> thoſe Books of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were tranſlated into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue by thoſe that are called the <hi>Seventy Interpreters.</hi> So as then the <hi>Grecians</hi> had the ſenſe and ſubſtance of them, though in another Language; whereby they were the leſs liable to be changed. Nay more, theſe <hi>Books</hi> were tranſlated both into the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue, and into that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, the half <hi>Syriac,</hi> a little before, and a little after the time of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Other <hi>Greek tranſlations</hi> afterward there were, as namely by <hi>Aquila, Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theodotion;</hi> all which <hi>Origen</hi> compared with that of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Interpreters;</hi> and after him others alſo, who could find no diverſity of <hi>hiſtory,</hi> or of any <hi>matter</hi> worth ſpeaking of.</p>

which two <hi>Writers</hi> alledge out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Books the <hi>ſame things</hi> that we read at this day.</p>
               <p>Now in theſe very times began <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to be more and more propagated, being profeſſed by many of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and by ſundry Perſons that had learned the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongue; who if the <hi>Jews</hi> had falſified in any notable part, could have quickly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it by comparing more ancient <hi>Copies,</hi> and ſo have made it publickly known. But they are ſo far from doing this, that on the other ſide they alledge many <hi>teſtimonies</hi> out of the old <hi>covenant,</hi> to the ſame ſenſe and meaning that they are uſed by the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> which <hi>Hebrews</hi> may ſooner be accuſed of any other fault, than (I will not ſay falſhood, but of ſo much as) negligence about theſe Books; which they have ſo religiouſly and exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and compared, that they know how often any one Letter is found therein.</p>
               <p>The laſt, though not the leaſt <hi>argument,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not purpoſely <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>alter</hi> the Scripture, may be, becauſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> out of the very <hi>Books</hi> which are read by the <hi>Jews</hi> do evince, and as they truſt very ſtrongly, that their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter Jeſus</hi> is that ſame very <hi>Meſſias</hi> which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

               <p>Thirdly, this was manifeſt by the manner of their <hi>worſhip,</hi> which no way beſeemed any good and honeſt <hi>Spirit;</hi> namely, by humane bloud, by the running of naked Men in the Temples, by Pageants and dancings, full of naſty filthineſs: ſuch as may be ſeen at this day among ſome People of <hi>America</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> who yet ſit in the darkneſs of <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, which is more, there both anciently were, and now are People, who worſhipt evil Spirits; which they knew and profeſſed to be ſuch: As the <hi>Perſians Arimanius,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> thoſe they called <hi>Cacodaemons,</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines their <hi>Vejoves;</hi> and now ſome <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> ſuch like Deities; than which

nothing can be imagined more impious.

Moreover, vain is that perſwaſion which they conceive of <hi>GOD,</hi> that <hi>he is good,</hi> and therefore will not <hi>puniſh</hi> this offence; becauſe they think ſo to do, were contrary to his <hi>goodneſs.</hi> For mercy or <hi>clemency,</hi> that it may be juſt, hath its bounds and limits: and where <hi>wickedneſs</hi> abounds beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there <hi>juſtice</hi> doth as it were neceſſarily require the infliction of <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Neither is it leſs blameable, that they pretend Fear conſtrains them to honour wicked Spirits: ſince He that is perfectly Good, is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative alſo; and therefore the Author of all other Natures, which are his productions. And if he be, then it follows that he hath <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> power and dominion over all <hi>creatures</hi> as over his workmanſhip; ſo that nothing can be done by <hi>any</hi> of them, which he hath <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> to hinder.

               <p>THE <hi>Pagans</hi> for the commendation of their <hi>Religion</hi> are wont to alledge <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> but <hi>ſuch</hi> as in many things may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt.</p>
               <p>For the wiſeſt Men among the <hi>Pagans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected many of theſe, as ſupported by no te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of any credible witneſs; but plainly counterfeit and fabulous. Other Miracles, which they ſaid were done, hapned in ſome ſecret place, in the night, before one or two, whoſe eyes the craft of the Prieſts might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily delude by falſe ſhows and appearances of things. And there are others which raiſed great admiration, and paſſed for wonders, meerly becauſe they met with thoſe, who were ignorant of natural things; eſpecially of hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den properties. As for inſtance, ſuch a thing might happen, if one ſhould draw Iron with the Loadſtone, among People who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its vertue: in which arts <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> as many have recorded, were very skilful.</p>
               <p>I do not deny, but ſome things greater than theſe were ſeen, which by Man's power alone
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94132:91"/>
could not be drawn out of natural cauſes; and yet did not need a power which was truly divine; that is, omnipotent: but might be performed by Spirits that are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men. Who by their celerity, efficacy, ſubtilty and diligence, can eaſily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things far diſtant from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and compound things that are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; to the working of ſuch effects, as ſhall ſtrike Men with aſtoniſhment. But that the Spirits, whereby this was effected, were not good, and therefore neither was the Religion good; appears already from what hath been ſaid before. And from hence alſo, that they ſaid they were compelled to do things, even againſt their wills, by the power of certain charms: when the wiſeſt of the <hi>Pagans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that there can be no ſuch vertue in words; but only a power of perſwaſion, and that no other way than by their ſignification.</p>
               <p>And it is another token of their wickedneſs, that they undertook to allure and draw this or that body, though never ſo backward to it, into the love of ſuch or ſuch a Perſon. Wherein they were injurious to them; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their vain promiſes, or in effecting what they promiſed: for this alſo is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by humane Laws, as a piece of Sorcery. Neither need any Man wonder why God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſome <hi>marvels</hi> to be wrought by evil
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94132:91"/>
                  <hi>Spirits</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſeeing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be cheated with ſuch illuſions, who ſo long time had forſaken the worſhip of the <hi>true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover this is an argument of their <hi>weakeneſs</hi> and impotency, that their <hi>works</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought any conſiderable good along with them. For if any ſeemed to be called back to life after they were dead, they did not continue alive; neither could they exerciſe the <hi>functions</hi> of living Creatures. Or if it happened that any thing proceeding happily from a <hi>divine power,</hi> did appear to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans;</hi> yet the ſame was not foretold ſhould come to paſs for the confirmation of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and therefore there might be other cauſes, and far different reaſons, which the divine efficacy propounded to it ſelf in the doing thoſe things. As for example, if it was true, that <hi>Vespaſian</hi> reſtored ſight to one blind; this was done, that he being thereby made more venerable, might the more eaſily obtain the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: to which he was choſen by God, that he might be a Miniſter of his Judgments upon the <hi>Jews.</hi> More ſuch like cauſes there may be of other <hi>wonders,</hi> which had no relation at all to their <hi>Religion.</hi>

Then again the words of the <hi>Oracles,</hi> for the moſt part, were <hi>ambiguous,</hi> and might eaſily receive an interpretation, from any event whatſoever. Or if there was any thing more expreſly foretold by them, yet it is not neceſſary that it ſhould proceed from an <hi>all-knowing mind:</hi> For it was either ſuch a thing as might be foreſeen by <hi>natural cauſes</hi> then exiſting, as ſome <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have foretold Diſeaſes that are a coming; or elſe ſome probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture might be made by that which commonly falls out and uſually comes to paſs, as we read of ſome <hi>perſons</hi> well skill'd in civil affairs, that have made notable gueſſes at <hi>future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</hi> Again, ſuppoſe that amongſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans God</hi> ſometimes uſed the <hi>miniſtery</hi> of ſome <hi>Prophets</hi> to foretel thoſe things, which could have no certain <hi>cauſe</hi> beſides the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God;</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:94132:92"/>
yet this did not approve or confirm their <hi>heatheniſh Religion,</hi> but rather overthew it. Such for inſtance are thoſe things, in the fourth Eclogue of <hi>Virgil,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Sibyls verſes;</hi> where unwittingly the <hi>Poet</hi> gives us a lively deſcription of the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his benefits. So in the ſame Books of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> it was, that he ought to be acknowledg'd as King, who ſhould be our King indeed: and that he was to come out of the Eaſt, who ſhould have <hi>dominion</hi> over all. We read in <hi>Porphyry</hi> of the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which ſaith, that other <hi>Gods</hi> are aerial <hi>Spirits,</hi> but the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is only to be worſhipped: which ſaying, if the worſhippers of <hi>Apollo</hi> obey, then they muſt ceaſe to worſhip him: if they do not obey it, then they make their <hi>God</hi> a Iyar. Add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if thoſe <hi>Spirits</hi> had reſpected or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good of Mankind, above all things, they would have preſcribed a general Rule of life to Mankind, and alſo given ſome certain aſſurance of a <hi>reward</hi> to them that lived ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; neither of which was ever done by them.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide oftentimes in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we find ſome <hi>Kings</hi> commended which were wicked men, ſome <hi>Champions</hi> extol'd and dignified with divine honour, others allured to immodeſt and unlawful love, or to the ſeeking after filthy lucre, or committing of

For if we take a view of all the Kingdoms and States that are among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> we ſhall find no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> but in <hi>Books.</hi> Nay <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> tell us, that even in thoſe times, when the Emperors endeavoured to uphold the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Religion either by violence and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as did the firſt of them; or by learning and ſubtilty, as did <hi>Julian;</hi> it notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decayed daily, not by any violent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor by the brightneſs and ſplendor of lineage and deſcent, (for Jeſus was accounted by the common ſort only a Carpenters Son;) nor by the flouriſhes of learning, which they that taught the Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed not in their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94132:93"/>
Sermons; nor by gifts and bribes, for they were poor; nor by any ſoothing and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeeches, for on the contrary they taught that all worldly advantages muſt be deſpiſed, and that all kind of adverſity muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for the <hi>Goſpel</hi>'s ſake. See then how weak and impotent <hi>Paganiſme</hi> was, which by ſuch means came to ruine.</p>
               <p>Neither did the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> only make the credulity of the Gentiles to vaniſh, but even bad <hi>Spirits</hi> came out of divers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at the name of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they became <hi>dumb</hi> alſo, and being demanded the reaſon of their ſilence, they were compelled to ſay, that they were able to do nothing where the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was called upon.</p>

               <p>THERE have been <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that did aſcribe the beginning and decay of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Religion</hi> unto the Stars: But this ſtar-gaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Science, which theſe Men profeſs to be skilled in, is delivered under ſuch different rules, that one can be certain of nothing, but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94132:94"/>
only this, that there is no certainty at all therein.</p>
               <p>I do not here ſpeak of ſuch effects as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from a natural neceſſity of cauſes, but of thoſe that proceed from the will of Man, which of it ſelf hath ſuch liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that no <hi>neceſſity</hi> or violence can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon it from without. For if the conſent of the <hi>will</hi> did neceſſarily follow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward impreſſion, then the power in our ſoul, which we may perceive it hath to conſult deliberate and chuſe, would be given in vain. Alſo the equity of all Laws, of all rewards and puniſhments would be taken away, ſeeing there can be neither <hi>fault</hi> nor <hi>merit</hi> in that which is altogether neceſſary and inevitable.</p>
               <p>Again, there are divers evil <hi>acts</hi> or effects of the will, which if they proceeded of any neceſſity from the <hi>Heavens,</hi> then the ſame <hi>Heavens</hi> and Celeſtial Bodies muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch efficacy from <hi>God,</hi> and ſo it would follow, that <hi>God,</hi> who is moſt <hi>perfectly good,</hi> is the true cauſe of that which is <hi>morally evil;</hi> And that when in his <hi>Law</hi> he profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to abhor <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> which a force inſerted by him into things themſelves will inevitably produce, he doth will two things contrary one to the other; that the ſame thing ſhould be done and not be done; and alſo that a Man offends in an action, which he doth by divine inſtigation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:94132:94"/>
They ſpeak more probably, that ſay the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> of the <hi>Stars</hi> do firſt affect the Air, then our Bodies, with ſuch qualities as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do excite and ſtir up in the mind ſome deſires or affections anſwerable thereunto: and the <hi>will</hi> being allured or inticed by theſe <hi>motions</hi> doth oftentimes yield unto them. But if this ſhould be granted, it makes nothing for the <hi>queſtion</hi> we have in hand. For ſeeing that <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> moſt of all withdraws Men from thoſe things which are pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, it cannot therefore have its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the <hi>affections</hi> of the body, and conſequently not from the <hi>influence</hi> of the <hi>Stars;</hi> which (as but now we ſaid) have no power over the mind, otherwiſe than by the <hi>mediation</hi> of thoſe <hi>affections.</hi> The moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent among <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> exempt truly wiſe and good Men from the dominion of the <hi>Stars:</hi> And <hi>ſuch</hi> verily were they that firſt profeſſed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> as their lives do ſhew. Or if there be any efficacy in learning and knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infection of the body, even among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there were ever ſome that were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> in this particular.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as the moſt learned do confeſs, the effects of the <hi>Stars</hi> reſpect certain <hi>Climates</hi> of the World, and are only for a ſeaſon; but this <hi>Religion</hi> hath now continued above the ſpace of one thouſand ſix hundred years, and that not in one part only, but in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

               <p>BUT the <hi>Pagans</hi> have the leſs to object againſt <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> becauſe all the parts thereof are of ſuch <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi> that they convince Mens minds by their own light. In ſo much that there have not been wanting Men among the <hi>Pagans</hi> alſo, who have here and there ſaid every one of thoſe things, which our Religion hath in a body all together.

that are in want: we muſt refrain from <hi>Swearing</hi> as much as may be: And as for our Food and Apparel we ought to content our ſelves with ſo much as will ſuffice nature, and the like. Or if happily there be ſome points in <hi>Christianity</hi> hard to be believed, yet the like alſo is found amongſt the wiſeſt of the <hi>Heathen</hi> themſelves; as before we have ſhewn concerning the <hi>immortality</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> and of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Bodies.

               <p>
                  <hi>Julian,</hi> as great an enemy as he was of <hi>Christians,</hi> thought that the Divine Nature might be joyned to the humane: and gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> whom he imagined to have deſcended from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to the end he might teach Men the Art of <hi>Phyſick.</hi> The <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> offendeth many: But what do not the <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers tell of their <hi>Gods?</hi> that ſome of them waited upon <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> others were Thunder-ſtruck, others cut in ſunder.

               <p>Thus that the Widows Oyl was increaſed by <hi>Eliſha:</hi> that <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cured of the Leproſie: that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Son in whoſe Houſe he lodged was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life, and other ſuch like, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the <hi>Jews</hi> for no other reaſon than becauſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> of good credit have record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>poſterity,</hi> that ſuch things were done.

Now it is plain that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94132:101"/>
the precepts of that <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not exactly <hi>perfect,</hi> becauſe many <hi>holy Men</hi> of thoſe times led a more excellent <hi>life</hi> than thoſe <hi>commandments</hi> required. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſuffered the <hi>revenge</hi> of a wrong to be exacted partly by blowes, and partly by ſentence of the Judges, himſelf being vexed with moſt bitter injuries, became an Interceſſor for his enemies. So <hi>David</hi> willing to have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <hi>Son</hi> to be ſpared, did patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure reproachful ſpeeches caſt upon himſelf. We no where read that any <hi>good Men</hi> put away their Wives, which notwithſtanding was permitted by the <hi>law.</hi> The reaſon of which is, that Laws are accommodated to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of a People: therefore in the ſtate and condition they were in, it was meet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be winked at; to be reduced to a more perfect Rule, when <hi>God</hi> by a greater <hi>efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> was to chuſe unto himſelf a new <hi>peculiar people</hi> out of all Nations. Yea, all the rewards which are expreſly promiſed by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> belong only to this <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life:</hi> wherefore it muſt be granted, that there might ſome better <hi>law</hi> be given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>reward</hi> of <hi>eternal happineſs</hi> ſhould be promiſed, not under any ſhadows, but in plain and expreſs terms: which we ſee is done by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> The Law of Moſes was obſerved by Jeſus, who aboliſhed no Commandments that were eſſentially good.</head>
               <p>AND here by the way, for the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Jews</hi> iniquity, it muſt be noted, that they who lived in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time, uſed him moſt baſely, and puniſhed him moſt unjuſtly; when as there could no juſt <hi>accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be laid againſt him for tranſgreſſing the <hi>Law.</hi> He was circumciſed; he uſed the ſame food and apparel that the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed: thoſe that were healed of Leproſie, he ſent unto the <hi>Prieſts:</hi> The <hi>Paſſeover</hi> and other <hi>Feſtival</hi> days he religiouſly obſerved: Though he did <hi>cure</hi> ſome upon the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> yet he ſhewed both by the <hi>Law</hi> and by the common received <hi>opinions,</hi> that ſuch works were not forbidden to be done upon the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi> Then it was, that he firſt began to publiſh the <hi>abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ſome <hi>Laws,</hi> when after his triumph over Death he aſcended into Heaven, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Diſciples</hi> upon Earth with illuſtrious gifts of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> whereby he made it evident that he had obtained a <hi>regal power,</hi> which includes in it the <hi>authority</hi> of making a <hi>Law:</hi> And that according to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94132:102"/>
                  <hi>ch. 3. &amp;</hi> 7. compared with <hi>chap. 8. &amp;</hi> 11. where he foretold, how that a little after the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (the latter whereof happened in the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,) GOD</hi> would give the Kingdom to a <hi>man</hi> (who ſhould ſeem but a vulgar Perſon) over all Nations and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which Kingdom ſhould never have an end.</p>
               <p>Now that part of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>neceſſity</hi> whereof was taken away by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> contained nothing that was <hi>honeſt</hi> in its own nature: but conſiſted of things that were indifferent in themſelves, and conſequently not <hi>immutable.</hi> For if thoſe things had had in them any thing of themſelves why they ſhould be done; then would <hi>God</hi> have preſcribed them not to <hi>one,</hi> but to <hi>all</hi> People; and not after that <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> had lived above the ſpace of Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, but even from the beginning of all. Neither <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck, Job, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> (though all of them were <hi>godly men,</hi> and dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>God)</hi> knew <hi>this part</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but were altogether ignorant, or very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith; yet notwithſtanding, for all that, they received the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of their <hi>confidence</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>love</hi> unto them. Beſides, neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> exhort <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father in law to the receiving of theſe <hi>rites,</hi> nor did <hi>Jonah</hi> the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> neither did any
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94132:102"/>
other <hi>Prophets</hi> reprehend the <hi>Chaldeans, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, Sydonians, Tyrians, Idumeans,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> for not admitting thoſe <hi>ceremonies,</hi> though when they writ unto them, they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up their <hi>ſins</hi> exactly enough. Theſe then were <hi>peculiar</hi> precepts introduced either for the avoiding of ſome evil, which the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>prone</hi> unto; or for the <hi>trial</hi> of their <hi>obedience,</hi> or for the <hi>ſignification</hi> of ſome <hi>future</hi> things.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is no more to be wondred, that <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> than if any King ſhould abrogate ſome <hi>Municipal Statutes,</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, that is, to particular Corporations) to the end he might eſtabliſh <hi>one law</hi> within his dominions. Neither can there any reaſon be alledged, to prove that <hi>God</hi> did ſo <hi>bind</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as that he would <hi>change</hi> nothing of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For if it be ſaid, that theſe precepts are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>perpetual,</hi> the ſame <hi>word</hi> Men oftentimes uſe, when they would ſignifie that <hi>that</hi> which they command is not <hi>yearly,</hi> or accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to certain times, ſuppoſe of War, Peace, or Scarcity. Yet they are not thereby hindred from making new <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the ſame things, ſpecially when the <hi>publick good</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Thus in like manner ſome of the Divine precepts given to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were <hi>temporary,</hi> during the Peoples abode in the <hi>Wilderneſs:</hi> others were ſtrictly tied to their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94132:103"/>
habitation in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> therefore to diſtinguiſh theſe from the other, he calls them perpetual, whereby might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that they ought not any where, or at any time to be <hi>intermitted,</hi> unleſs <hi>God</hi> ſignified that it was his <hi>will</hi> ſo to be. Which manner of ſpeaking, ſince it is commonly uſed by all <hi>people,</hi> ought to be leſs wondered at by the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> who know that in their Law it is called a <hi>perpetual ſtatute,</hi> and a <hi>perpetual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> which continues only from one <hi>Jubilee</hi> to another: And the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is called by them the accompliſhment of the <hi>Jubilee,</hi> or the greateſt <hi>Jubilee</hi> of all. Thus in the <hi>Hebrew Prophets,</hi> there was anciently a promiſe of making a <hi>new covenant,</hi> as in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> xxxi. where God promiſeth that <hi>he will make a new covenant, which ſhall be put into their inward parts, and written in their hearts, neither ſhall men have any need, that one ſhall learn Religion of another, for it ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto all.</hi> Yea further, <hi>the Lord will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them their former iniquities, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſin no more:</hi> which is as if a King after great <hi>enmity</hi> and diſcord amongſt his Citizens and Subjects, ſhould for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of <hi>peace</hi> and tranquillity among them, take away all diverſity of Laws, and make one perfect <hi>Law common</hi> to them all, promiſing forgiveneſs of faults by-paſt, if hereafter they do amend. And this which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94132:103"/>
hath been ſaid might ſuffice, but we will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey every part of the Law which is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſhew they were neither ſuch as in themſelves could be well pleaſing unto <hi>God,</hi> nor ought they to <hi>continue</hi> for ever.</p>

               <p>THE firſt and chief thing to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which many of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> think were invented by <hi>Man,</hi> before that they were commanded by <hi>God.</hi> And true it is indeed, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of abundance of Rites and Ceremonies, ſo that there was cauſe enough why GOD ſhould enjoyn them very many, if it were but for this reaſon, leſt they ſhould return unto the <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> by the remembrance of their <hi>ſojourning</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit when their <hi>Poſterity</hi> made too great account of them, as though of themſelves they had been acceptable unto <hi>God,</hi> and a part of <hi>true piety;</hi> then did the <hi>Prophets</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them for it: About Sacrifices, ſaith God by <hi>David,</hi> in the fiftieth Pſalm, <hi>I will not ſo much as exchange a word with thee; as if I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94132:104"/>
were deſirous to have thy burnt offerings conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before me. I will take no Buliock out of thy houſe, nor he-goats out of thy folds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For every beaſt of the foreſt is mine, and ſo are the cattel upon a thouſand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wila beaſts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the World is mine, and the fulneſs thereof: thinkeſt thou that I will eat the fleſh of Bulls, or drink the bloud of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the moſt high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some there are among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who ſay that this is ſpoken, becauſe they that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thoſe <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> were of an <hi>impure</hi> mind, and diſhoneſt converſation. But the words now alledged ſhew <hi>another matter,</hi> to wit, that the <hi>thing</hi> in it ſelf was no whit acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God.</hi> For if we conſider the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we ſhall and that <hi>God</hi> in theſe words ſpeaks unto the godly: for he had ſaid, <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me,</hi> and <hi>hear my people:</hi> which are the words of a Teacher and one that inſtructeth. Then having ended thoſe words now alledged, as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, he ſpeaks unto the <hi>wicked: But unto the wicked God ſaith.</hi> To the ſame ſenſe we may cite other places, as in the 51. Pſal. <hi>Thou deſireſt not ſacrifice, elſe would I give it thee, but thou delighteſt not in burnt-offerings. The ſacrifice of God is a broken Spirit: a broken
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94132:104"/>
and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> So likewiſe in the fortieth Pſalm; <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire, but hast tied me to thee, as he whoſe ear was boared through, to be thy ſervant: burnt-offering and ſin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, Loe, I come: In the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea thy Law is within my heart. I have preached righteouſneſs in the great Congregation: Loe, I have not refrained my Lips, O Lord, thou knoweſt. I have not hid thy righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my heart, I have declared thy faithfulneſs and thy ſalvation: I have not concealed thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs, and thy truth from the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> The like we read in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, chap. 1. To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord? I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beaſts, and I delight not in the bloud of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my Courts?</hi> Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this place, and the Interpreter of it, is that in <hi>Jer. 7. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael; Put your burnt-offerings unto your ſacrifices, and eat their fleſh your ſelves: For I ſpake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the Land of Egypt, concerning burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and ſacrifices. But this thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94132:105"/>
I them ſaying Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.</hi> Agreeing with this, is that in <hi>Hoſea 6. To ſhew mercy to men, is more acceptable to me than ſacrifice, to think rightly of God more than all burnt-offerings.</hi> Laſtly, in the ſixth of <hi>Micah,</hi> when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was made, what was the beſt way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the favour of God? whether by coming before him with a great number of rams, or with a great quantity of Oyl, or with Calves of a Year old? to this <hi>God</hi> anſwers and ſaith, <hi>I will tell thee what is truly good and acceptable unto me; namely, to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which places it being apparent, that Sacrifices are not in the number of thoſe things which God deſires for themſelves or primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that the People (a naughty ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion creeping in, as is uſual, by little and little among them) placed a great part of their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them, and believed they made a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent compenſation for their ſins by ſacrifices: what wonder is it, if God at length took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a thing, which was not now in its own nature indifferent, but whoſe uſe was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Vice? ſince King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not ſtick to break even the brazen Serpent, erected by <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe the People began to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it with Religious Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:94132:105"/>
Moreover, there are divers <hi>Prophecies,</hi> that foretold theſe <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> whereof we ſpeak, ſhould come to an end: which any one may eaſily conceive, who doth but conſider that according to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> only the <hi>poſterity</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> was to do <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and that only in their own Country. But in the 110 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> there is a <hi>King</hi> promiſed, whoſe <hi>dominion</hi> ſhould be moſt ample, the beginning whereof <hi>ſhould be out of Sion:</hi> and this ſame <hi>King</hi> was to be a <hi>Prieſt alſo for ever, and that after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap. 19. That there ſhall be an altar to the Lord in the midſt of the Land of Egypt,</hi> where not only the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall worſhip <hi>God.</hi> And in the 66 <hi>chapter,</hi> he ſaith, that the People of all Nations and Languages which are far and widely diſtant, ſhall <hi>come</hi> as well as the <hi>Iſraelites, and offer gifts unto God,</hi> and of them alſo there ſhall <hi>be ordained Prieſts and Levites:</hi> All which could not come to paſs ſo long as the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> remained in force. Add unto theſe that in the firſt of <hi>Malachy</hi> God foretelling future things, ſaith he, abhorred the offerings of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, I have no pleaſure in you, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the riſing of the Sun even unto the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94132:106"/>
unto my name, and a pure offering, for my name ſhall be great among the Heathen, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Daniel</hi> in his 9. chapter rehearſing the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> concerning Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>that he ſhall cauſe the ſacrifice and the oblation to ceaſe.</hi> And not by words only, but <hi>really</hi> and indeed <hi>God</hi> plainly enough ſhews that he likes not any longer thoſe <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> which were preſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſeeing that he hath ſuffered the <hi>Jews</hi> for the ſpace of one thouſand ſix hundred years and more to be without <hi>Temple,</hi> without <hi>Altar,</hi> and without any certain diſtinction of their Tribes or <hi>Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;</hi> whence it might appear who <hi>they</hi> are that may lawfully offer <hi>ſacrifice.</hi>

               <p>Again, that theſe <hi>precepts</hi> were not <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> it is manifeſt by that <hi>ſtatute</hi> which was made touching the <hi>fleſh</hi> of a Beaſt, that died of it ſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. which to eat was not <hi>lawful</hi> for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but it was lawful for the <hi>ſtrangers</hi> that dwelt among them, unto whom the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>divine</hi> command were to perform all offices of <hi>courteſie,</hi> as perſons eſteemed by God.

For after that the People were brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and had happily paſſed over the <hi>red Sea,</hi> the next day they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a <hi>Sabbath</hi> of <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>ſafety;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſang a <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>triumph</hi> and rejoicing: from which time that <hi>exact reſt</hi> upon the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> was commanded, which is firſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon occaſion of gathering the <hi>Manna, Exod.</hi> 16. 23. <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 2. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 3. And in this ſenſe the deliverance from <hi>Aegypt</hi> is made the reaſon for the Law of the <hi>Sabbath, Deut.</hi> 5. 15. By which <hi>Law</hi> proviſion alſo was made for <hi>ſervants</hi> againſt the ſeverity of thoſe <hi>maſters,</hi> that would not grant them any
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94132:108"/>
reſt or relaxation from <hi>daily labour,</hi> as may be ſeen in the places aforeſaid. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>ſtrangers</hi> were bound to obſerve this <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe it was meet there ſhould be one <hi>form</hi> of <hi>reſt</hi> among all the People; but this <hi>Law</hi> of ſo exact <hi>reſting</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not given to other People, as may appear by this, that in many places it is called a <hi>ſign,</hi> and a ſpecial <hi>covenant</hi> alſo between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. &amp; 16. Now we have proved before by the <hi>promiſe</hi> of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>benefits,</hi> that the <hi>ordinances</hi> which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for a <hi>memorial</hi> of the coming out from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were not <hi>ſuch</hi> as ought <hi>never</hi> to ceaſe. Add moreover, if the <hi>Law</hi> concerning the <hi>reſt</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had been given from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and in that ſenſe, that it never might be aboliſhed; then ſurely that Law had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over other laws, when there was a claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them: which we find was quite contrary, by its yielding to them. For it is evident, that Infants were rightly <hi>circumciſed</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> like, as during the time that the <hi>Temple</hi> ſtood, there were Beaſts killed for <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> as well upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as upon other days. Yea, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Maſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhew the mutability of this <hi>law,</hi> when they ſay, that by a <hi>Prophet</hi>'s appointment and <hi>command</hi> a work may be rightly done upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi>-day: And this they prove by the taking of <hi>Jerico</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> according
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94132:108"/>
to the commandment of <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> And ſome of them not unfitly ſhew, that the diſtinction of days ſhall be taken away in the time of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> from that place in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> lxvi. 23. where it is propheſied, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that the worſhip of God ſhall be perpetual from one new Moon to another, from one Sabbath to another.</hi>

in the place of this <hi>covenant,</hi> a <hi>new covenant</hi> was to ſucceed, which ſhould be common to all People: For which cauſe the neceſſity of that note of <hi>diſtinction,</hi> ought to ceaſe.

               <p>Wherefore the <hi>promiſes</hi> alſo annexed to <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> are in like manner to be referred to ſome greater thing: As that of <hi>earthly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> to the revelation of a poſſeſſion truly eternal; which was never made more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt than by <hi>Jeſus:</hi> So that promiſe of making <hi>Abraham a Father of many Nations,</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that <hi>time,</hi> when not a few, but an infinite number of People diſperſed thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World, ſhould imitate <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Faith and confidence in <hi>God,</hi> which is ſo often mentioned in Scripture; and this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to paſs, but in the time of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> Now it is no marvel, if the <hi>ſhadows of an intended work</hi> be taken away, when the <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf is accompliſht.

               <p>THE Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> to whom <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath given a Teſtimony of exceeding great Piety, neither would willingly <hi>deceive</hi> us, nor was himſelf <hi>deceived</hi> by the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> Now He, taught by the ſame <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> in the Ninth Chapter of his <hi>Prophecie</hi> hath left it recorded, that before <hi>five hundred</hi> years ſhould be expired, after the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>decree</hi> touching the reſtoring of the City <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come.

Nations by a Divine authority, after that the <hi>poſterity</hi> of <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had ceaſed to reign; the latter whereof ended in <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> a little before <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born.

Hereunto likewiſe belongs that in the ſecond Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> where God by the Prophet comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Zerubbabel, the Son of Shealtiel, Governor of Judah, and Joſhuah the Son of Joſedech the high Prieſt,</hi> who were ſorrowful to ſee the Temple, which they built, fall ſo ſhort of the firſt Temple; with this promiſe, <hi>that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the latter houſe ſhould be greater than the former:</hi> which certainly can neither be meant of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the work, nor of the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the building, nor of the fabrick and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial <hi>structure,</hi> nor of the ornaments of that Temple; as may appear by the <hi>hiſtory</hi> of thoſe times, both in the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and in <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> compared with that of the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Add to this, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors note, this latter Temple wanted <hi>two</hi> of the greateſt indowments, which the former enjoyed, <hi>viz.</hi> A certain <hi>conspicuous Light,</hi>

which was the token of the Divine Majeſty there, and <hi>Divine Inſpiration.</hi> But God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf briefly declares, in that very place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the latter Temple ſhould excel the former; when He promiſes He would ſettle, as by a ſure Covenant, <hi>His Peace,</hi> i. e. his favour and loving kindneſs, in that Temple.

It is moſt manifeſt by the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>David, Iſaiah, Zachariah,</hi> and <hi>Hoſea,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be an <hi>Inſtructor,</hi> not only of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> that by him the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of falſe Gods ſhould fall to the ground, and a huge multitude of <hi>aliens</hi> and <hi>ſtrangers</hi> ſhould be brought to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of the only <hi>true God.</hi> Before <hi>Jeſus</hi> his coming almoſt the whole World was overſpread with falſe <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> and <hi>religions:</hi> which afterward by little and little began to <hi>vaniſh</hi> away, and not only ſingle perſons, but both People and Kings were converted unto the <hi>worſhip</hi> and ſervice of one <hi>God.</hi> This was not owing to the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins;</hi> but to the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and their Succeſſors. Thus <hi>they</hi> were made the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that before were not the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and the ſaying of old <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49. was fulfilled, That before all civil Authority ſhould be taken from <hi>Judah, Shilo</hi> ſhould come.

               <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> uſually object, that <hi>ſome things</hi> were foretold, concerning the times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which are not yet fulfilled. But for anſwer, <hi>thoſe matters</hi> which they alledge are obſcure, and admit of divers <hi>ſignifications:</hi> wherefore we ought not, becauſe of them, to forſake thoſe things that are manifeſt. Such as the <hi>holineſs</hi> of the <hi>commandments</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> the excellency of the <hi>reward,</hi> and the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous <hi>language,</hi> wherein it is propounded: to which if we add the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, theſe ought to be ſufficient induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the receiving of his <hi>doctrine.</hi> As for thoſe <hi>Prophecies</hi> which go under the name of a ſhut or claſped Book, oftentimes for the right underſtanding thereof, there is requiſite ſome <hi>divine helps</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtances,</hi> which they are worthily deprived of, that neglect mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>truths.</hi> The places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which they object are <hi>diverſly</hi> expounded, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot deny. And if any Men pleaſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94132:115"/>
to compare either the ancient Interpreters, which lived when the People were led captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> or ſuch as lived about <hi>Christ</hi>'s time, with thoſe that writ after that <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> began to be hateful and odious unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſhall find new <hi>expoſitions</hi> purpoſely invented, to croſs thoſe former, that well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the ſenſe of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They know well enough that there are many things in the holy Scriptures, which muſt be underſtood by a figure, and not in propriety of ſpeech; as when <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to have deſcended; and to have a mouth, ears, eyes and noſthrils. And why may not we likewiſe <hi>expound</hi> divers things, that are ſpoken of the <hi>times</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> after the ſame manner; as that the <hi>Wolf</hi> ſhall dwell with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard ſhall lye down with the Kid,</hi> and the <hi>Calf</hi> and the <hi>young Lion,</hi> and the <hi>fatling</hi> together; and the <hi>ſucking child</hi> ſhall play with the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents:</hi> and the <hi>mountain</hi> of the Lord ſhall be exalted above other mountains, whither <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſhall come and <hi>worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome things <hi>promiſed,</hi> which by antecedent or conſequent words, or by the very ſenſe imply <hi>a tacite condition</hi> in them.

               <p>MANY do take exception at the low and <hi>mean condition</hi> of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, becauſe in <hi>ſacred Writ</hi> it is often ſaid, that <hi>God will exalt the humble, but caſt down the proud.

               <p>

Now concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> we read, that he ſhould be a gladſome <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> unto the poor, that he ſhould make no noiſe in publick, nor uſe any ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but deal <hi>gently,</hi> forbearing to break the ſhaken reed, and cheriſhing that heat which remains in ſmoaking flax.</p>
               <p>Neither ought the reſt of his <hi>afflictions,</hi> no not his <hi>ignominious death,</hi> to make him deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any. For <hi>God</hi> oftentimes ſuffereth the <hi>godly,</hi> not only to be vexed and diſquieted by the <hi>wicked,</hi> as righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was by the Citizens of <hi>Sodom:</hi> but alſo even to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed</hi> and ſlain, as is plain by the example of <hi>Abel,</hi> who was cruelly <hi>murdered</hi> by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who was <hi>ſawn</hi> in pieces; and of the <hi>ſeven brethren</hi> in the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> who, together with their <hi>mother,</hi> were miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably tormented and put to death. The very <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves ſing the <hi>Seventy-ninth Pſalm,</hi> wherein are theſe words, <hi>The dead bodies of thy ſervants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven: the fleſh of thoſe whom thou loveſt, O God, unto the beaſts of the earth. Their bloud have they ſhed like water round about Jeruſalem: and there was none to bury them.</hi> And whoſoever conſiders the words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the 53. Chapter, cannot deny that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf ought to have paſſed thorow much <hi>affliction</hi> and death, to come into his Kingdom, and obtain power
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94132:117"/>
to <hi>adorn</hi> his Houſhold or Church with the moſt excellent bleſſings.</p>
               <p>The words in the <hi>Prophet</hi> are theſe; <hi>Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of the dry ground: He hath no form or comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and rejected of men; a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs: And we hide as it were our faces from him. He was ſo deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in ſo ſmall eſteem among us. Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: he was bruiſed for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we, like ſheep, have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way: And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth. He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth. After impriſonment and ſentence paſſed on him, he was taken away: but who ſhall worthily declare his duration when he was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to life again? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; but for the tranſgreſſion of my people he was ſtricken; and he made his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94132:117"/>
grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death: though he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. But though it hath pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and he hath put him to grief; Yet becauſe he made himſelf an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days; and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall prosper in his hand; He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many; by taking away their iniquities. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the strong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death. And he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Who is there either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Prophets,</hi> to whom theſe things can be applyed? Surely none. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that <hi>ſhift,</hi> which ſome later <hi>Jews</hi> have invented, telling us, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks here of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> diſperſed thorow all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> that, by their example and perſwaſion, they might every where make many Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes: this ſenſe is firſt of all repugnant to many teſtimonies of holy Writ, which loudly proclaim, that no evil is befaln the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they have not deſerved (and a great deal more beſide) for their evil deeds. He alſo, of whom <hi>Eſaias</hi> treats, was to deprecate God for the Heathen, which the <hi>Jews</hi> do not. And laſtly,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94132:118"/>
the very order and ſeries of the Prophetical Diſcourſe, will not bear that interpretation. For either the <hi>Prophet,</hi> (which ſeems <hi>more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to that place) or <hi>God</hi> ſaith; <hi>This evil hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him for the iniquities of my People.</hi> Now the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> or the <hi>peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are the <hi>people</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> therefore he who is ſaid by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch grievous things, cannot be that ſame People.</p>
               <p>But the ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> more ingenuouſly <hi>confeſs,</hi> that theſe things were ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> whereupon ſome later among them have deviſed two <hi>Meſſiaſes;</hi> the one they call the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was to ſuffer many miſeries, and a bloudy death: the other is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> to whom all things ſhould ſucceed proſperouſly.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94132:119"/>
up again the Fowl that they had eaten.

Now, as concerning the <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> they were ſuch as <hi>conſpired</hi> the death of <hi>Jeremy</hi> by a falſe accuſation, and had kill'd him indeed, unleſs they had been hindered by the authority of ſome of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: notwithſtanding which, they prevailed ſo far, as to have him impriſoned until the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment that the <hi>City</hi> was taken. If any Man imagine thoſe were any thing better, that lived in the times of <hi>Jeſus, Joſephus</hi> will ſhew him his <hi>error;</hi> who deſcribes their villanous <hi>acts,</hi> and grievous puniſhments, ſuch, as the like were never heard of, and yet, as he thinks, below their deſert. Neither may we conceive more favourably of their <hi>great Council</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> ſpecially, becauſe at that time the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> were not choſen after the old cuſtome, by laying on of hands, but by the pleaſure, or ſway of powerful Men: as the High-Prieſts alſo were not elected for term of life, but obtained that dignity only from year to year, and that oftentimes for <hi>money.</hi> We need not then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if Men that were puffed up with pride, unſatiable in their <hi>ambition</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> did break out into fury and madneſs, when

to his Diſciples; which <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhould be <hi>ſigns</hi> of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Add unto theſe, that his <hi>Scepter,</hi> that is, the Word of the Goſpel being gone out of <hi>Sion,</hi> is run through the World (and that not by humane help, but by the Divine Power alone) to the utmoſt parts of the Earth: whoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and their Kings He hath ſubdued to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; juſt as the <hi>Pſalms</hi> did plainly foretel. The <hi>Jewiſh Cabaliſts</hi> place a certain Son of <hi>Enoch</hi> in the middle, between God and Men; without any indication of ſuch a power: with how much better reaſon do we give Him that dignity, who hath ſo evidently demonſtrated that it belongs to Him?</p>
               <p>Neither doth this tend, in the leaſt, to the diminution or leſſening of the glory of God the Father: from whom this power of <hi>Jeſus</hi> doth proceed; to whom it muſt return; and to whoſe honour alſo it miniſters and ſerves.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94132:123"/>
began by little and little to wax cold; from the time that by the favour of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the following Emperors, that profeſſion was become not only ſafe, but alſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: the World being, as it were, thruſt into the Church.</p>
               <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> of all, Chriſtian Princes would needs continue fighting, and make no end of their Wars: even then, when they might have enjoyed peace and quietneſs.</p>
               <p>Among the Biſhops alſo, there were moſt ſharp Contentions about the Chiefeſt Sees. And as at the beginning the greateſt miſchiefs inſued, upon the preferring of the Tree of <hi>knowledge,</hi> before the Tree of <hi>Life;</hi> even ſo then alſo was curious Learning more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than a godly Life, and Religion turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Art. The conſequent of which was, that, after the example of thoſe, who built the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> a raſh affectation of things out of their reach, bred jarring and confuſion in their Language; together with diſcord one with another. Which the common People obſerving, and not knowing oft-times which way to turn themſelves, they threw the blame upon the holy Scriptures; and began to avoid them, as hurtful and dangerous.</p>
               <p>Religion alſo began every where to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not in purity of mind, but, as if <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was brought back into the World, in Rites and Ceremonies: and in ſuch things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94132:123"/>
rather an exerciſe of the body, than any amendment of the mind: and in an eager zeal for that Party and ſide, which they had once choſen. Till at length it came to paſs, that there were every where many Chriſtians in Name; but very few in Deed.</p>
               <p>GOD did not wink at theſe Vices of his People, but, out of the innermoſt parts of <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> poured forth, like a Deluge, immenſe ſwarms of Barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the Chriſtian World. And when the vaſt ſlaughters, which they made, proved not ſufficient to correct and amend the lives of thoſe that ſurvived; <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by God's juſt permiſſion, ſowed a new Religion in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia:</hi> and that directly oppoſite to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; but which in words expreſſed, in a manner, the life of the greateſt part of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>This Religion was firſt entertained by the <hi>Saracens;</hi> who had revolted from <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour: and by their Arms ſubdued, in a ſhort ſpace, <hi>Arabia, Syria, Paleſtine, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Perſia;</hi> and afterward poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of <hi>Africa,</hi> and, beyond the Sea, of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo. But the power of the <hi>Saracens</hi> was abated, as by others, ſo chiefly by the <hi>Turks;</hi> a Nation alſo very Warlike: which, after long combates with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> being invited to Peace, eaſily embraced a Religion ſuited to their manners; and transferred the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94132:124"/>
Majeſty of the Empire to themſelves. The Cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> were taken, and, by the growing ſucceſs of their Arms, they came into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Borders of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>

               <p>IT is granted by <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent of <hi>God;</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> alſo: and that they were holy Men, which firſt of all publiſhed the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which is <hi>Mahumet</hi>'s law, many things are recorded plain contrary to what is delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Thus to give one example for many, all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Diſciples of <hi>Christ,</hi> with one conſent do <hi>teſtifie,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>crucified;</hi> that the third day he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to <hi>life</hi> again, and after that was <hi>ſeen</hi> of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94132:125"/>
many. But <hi>Mahumet</hi> teacheth quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: namely, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was privily conveyed into <hi>Heaven:</hi> and not himſelf, but ſomething in his <hi>likeneſs</hi> was nailed to the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and conſequently; he did not die; but the ſight of the <hi>Jews</hi> was deluded and deceived.</p>
               <p>This Objection cannot be put off, unleſs <hi>Mahumet</hi> ſay, (as he doth) that the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples, have not remained as they were at firſt; but have been <hi>corrupted.</hi> But we have confuted this <hi>fiction</hi> before, in the third Book.</p>
               <p>Without doubt, if any Man ſhould ſay, that the <hi>Alchoran</hi> is corrupted, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> would deny it, and ſay, that were an anſwer ſufficient to thoſe that could not prove the contrary: But they cannot moreover, for the integrity of their Book, alledge ſuch <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as we do produce, concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Copies, that were in a ſhort ſpace diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed thorowout the World; and that, not as the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> in one Language; which <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> were preſerved by the fidelity of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Sects,</hi> that varied much about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are perſwaded, that in the fourteenth Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> where mention is made of ſending the <hi>Comforter,</hi> there hath been ſomething regiſtred concerning <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have razed out. But here let me ask of them, whether they think
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94132:125"/>
this <hi>depravation</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> was committed ſince the time of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> or before.</p>
               <p>That it happened not after the coming of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> is plain, becauſe ever ſince that time there have been in the World very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Copies,</hi> not only in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, but in the <hi>Syriac, Arabick,</hi> and in parts far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Arabia,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues of divers <hi>tranſlations:</hi> all which do ſo agree in that place, as there cannot be ſhown any diverſity at all. And before the time of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> there was no cauſe of alteration: For no Man could know before his coming what <hi>Mahumet</hi> would teach. Yea, if the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Mahumet</hi> had contained nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would have made no more difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his <hi>Books,</hi> than they did to receive the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew Prophets.</hi> Or ſuppoſe there had been nothing written either of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> or of <hi>Mahumet:</hi> It is but equity that <hi>that</hi> be received for the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>agree upon;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> for the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> which all <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do allow of.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>ſucceeded</hi> them: as likewiſe by the very <hi>patient enduring</hi> of the torments and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that <hi>Christians</hi> ſuffered. But the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> of <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> wrought no <hi>miracles</hi> at all: neither did they ſuffer any grievous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or cruel kinds of <hi>death</hi> for their <hi>profeſſion:</hi> But it is a Religion which follows, where Arms go before: of which it is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and nothing of it ſelf. Nor do they themſelves bring any better <hi>argument</hi> for the <hi>truth</hi> thereof, than their <hi>good ſucceſs</hi> in their Wars, and the <hi>largeneſs</hi> of their Empire; than which nothing in this point is more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful</hi> and uncertain.</p>
               <p>They condemn the <hi>worſhip</hi> and ſervices of the <hi>Pagans:</hi> and yet we know what great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories were won by the <hi>Perſians, Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> and how ample their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were.

               <p>And truly, it is no wonder, if ſome <hi>childiſh rudiments</hi> were taught before the moſt perfect <hi>law,</hi> as that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is: But after the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation</hi> thereof, to return again to <hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> were prepoſterous.

               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are admoniſhed faithfully, and with due care to preſerve the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a moſt <hi>precious treaſure:</hi> And for this cauſe, let them often <hi>read</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate</hi> the Books of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no Man can be <hi>deceived,</hi> unleſs firſt he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> himſelf.

               <p>Howbeit, for the right <hi>underſtanding</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we muſt bring a mind diſpoſed and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to obedience: which if we do, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be hid from us, which ought to be

                  <hi>Circumciſion</hi> that is made with hands, is now nothing worth, but it is the inward <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> of the heart, the keeping of <hi>Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> the <hi>new</hi> creature, <hi>faith</hi> that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in love, which make Men known to be <hi>true Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>myſtical Jews,</hi> that is, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>commendable</hi> in his ſight.

               </p>
               <p>Upon the ſame occaſion <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the <hi>weapons</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of their <hi>Chriſtian warfare,</hi> are not ſuch as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet</hi> uſed, but <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> able to caſt down <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> and every thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For our

If any do excel the reſt in <hi>underſtanding,</hi> it is but meet alſo that they ſurpaſs them in love, in holy <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>endeavours</hi> to do them good. And as for thoſe that in ſome points are of <hi>different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:94132:132"/>
from ſuch as hold the <hi>truth; God</hi>'s leiſure muſt be waited for, until it pleaſe him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the ſame <hi>truth,</hi> that yet lies hid from them: and in the mean while thoſe things which are agreed upon, muſt be ſtedfaſtly kept and duly practiſed.</p>
               <p>We know now in part only, but the time ſhall come, when all things ſhall be known moſt plainly, and after a perſpicuous manner. This alſo I beg of every one, that they do not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably</hi> detain the <hi>talent</hi> committed to them upon truſt; but that they <hi>endeavour</hi> by all means poſſible to <hi>win</hi> others unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For which purpoſe, we muſt not only uſe good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and wholſome <hi>ſpeeches,</hi> but alſo the <hi>example</hi> of good life; that ſo the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of our <hi>Maſter</hi> may appear by his <hi>ſervants,</hi> and the purity of the <hi>law</hi> by our <hi>landable actions.</hi>
               </p>

For, as this is common to every Religion, to have many diſputes about it, and different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in it; and as Chriſt and his Apoſtles foretold there would many <hi>falſe Chriſts</hi> and <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> ariſe (as was ſaid before in the end of the foregoing Book) who would lye, and ſay they were ſent, when they were not, introducing falſe doctrines, and calling them by the Name of his Religion; and as they give us a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo why it ſhould be ſo; that Mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity and ſincerity might be tried, and brought hereby to the touchſtone, and that their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care in preſerving themſelves might be exerciſed: So, bleſſed be our Lord, the true Chriſtian Religion is ſtill retained, and kept intire every where, by all theſe diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties; notwithſtanding the fierce quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels they have one with another. As appears by this (which is a ſhort, eaſie, and certain way to our ſatisfaction in this matter) that the Faith into which they are all baptized, is one and the ſame without any variation. That is, they all enter into the Church at the very ſame gate; and upon the ſame terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, neither more nor leſs, are made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and have a title given them, if they live according to this Faith, unto Eternal Salvation.</p>

               <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, which now makes the greateſt differences in the Chriſtian World, requires nothing more at this day to be believed by thoſe, that are by Baptiſm received into the Church of Chriſt; but only thoſe things which are contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> commonly called the Apoſtles. This <hi>Creed</hi> is recited there by the Prieſt, and this alone, when he comes to the Font; and he interrogates the Perſons to be baptized (if they be adult) or their undertakers (if they be Infants) about no other belief. Upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of which, he bids them enter into the holy Church of God, that they may receive the Celeſtial bleſſing from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and have a part with Him and with his Saints: And having again examined adult Perſons, asking them, <hi>Do ye believe in God the Father Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. and mentioning no other Articles of Faith, he baptizes them; and declares them to be regenerate, and to have remiſſion of all ſins. And ſo do we do here; nor is there any different practice in any other part of the Chriſtian World; but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94132:136"/>
every where it is ſufficient to conſent to this Creed: which is nothing but a brief explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what we are to believe concerning the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> in whoſe Name we are baptized.</p>
               <p>If there were any thing beyond this, which we are neceſſarily bound to believe, it ſhould have been then propounded when we were admitted into the ſtate of Chriſtianity. For Baptiſm gives us a right and title to Salvation (if we do not forfeit it afterward by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, or by a wicked life) and this Faith (with a promiſe to live according to it) gives us a right to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Herein indeed the <hi>Roman</hi> Church contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it ſelf, in decreeing many other Articles of belief, without which it declares Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved; and yet receiving Men at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into a ſtate of Salvation, without demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their conſent to any ſuch Articles. But ſo they do in many other things, and cannot avoid it: while they forſake the ancient Univerſal Rule; and ſet up their own private Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to impoſe what they pleaſe, under pain of Damnation.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> But both contradicts it ſelf, and departs from the Ancient and truly Catholick Church.</head>
               <p>FOR that no ſuch things, as they would now oblige all Chriſtians to believe, were anciently exacted, it appears moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> (to name no others) in ſeveral places. Who call the <hi>Creed</hi> now mentioned, <hi>the Rule of Truth, and the Rule of Faith:</hi> which the Church throughout all the World, ſaith <hi>Irenaeus (though it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed to the moſt extream parts of the Earth) received from the Apostles and their Diſciples: and believes, as if there were but one Soul and one Heart, in ſo many Men: and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſent preaches and teaches, and delivers theſe things, as having but one mouth. For though there be divers Languages in the World, yet one and the ſame Tradition prevails every where: For neither the Churches in</hi> Germany <hi>believe otherways, or deliver any thing elſe; nor they in</hi> Spain, <hi>nor they in</hi> France; <hi>nor they in the</hi> Eaſt; <hi>nor they in</hi> Egypt; <hi>nor they in</hi> Libya; <hi>nor they that are founded in the midſt of the World. But as the Sun is one and the ſame in the whole World: So is the preaching
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94132:137"/>
of the Truth, inlightning all Men, who will come to the knowledge of it. And neither he who is most eloquent among the Governours of the Church, preaches any thing different, (for no man is above his Master) nor doth he that is weakest in ſpeech leſſen in the leaſt this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For there being one and the ſame Faith, he that hath moſt to ſay cannot inlarge it; nor he that hath leaſt, diminiſh it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they declared their minds in thoſe early days; when there was no Catholick Man or Woman in the World, required to believe any of thoſe Doctrines, now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: (and ſet down in the <hi>Creed</hi> of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. as neceſſary to Salvation) but they all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with the ſimple belief of thoſe things which the Apoſtles have delivered in their Creed; the greateſt Men in the Church delivering no more, nor the meaneſt ſaying leſs. And with this wiſe and good Men ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelves in times ſucceeding, as appears by this remarkable paſſage of St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> in his little Book, which he himſelf delivered to the Emperour <hi>Constantius.</hi> Where he thus complains, <hi>Faith is now enquired after; as if we had none. Faith must be ſet down in writing; as if it were not in the heart. Being regenerated by Faith, we are now taught what to believe; as if that regeneration could have been without Faith.</hi> WE LEARN CHRIST

               <p>TO pretend that all thoſe Articles of Faith, which they now impoſe, though not expreſly mentioned in the Creed, yet are contained in one Article of it, Viz. <hi>in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Holy Catholick Church;</hi> is, in effect, to make all the reſt of the Creed unneceſſary, and to eſtabliſh this ſole Rule of Faith in the room of it.

               <p>But the vanity of this further appears, in that none of the ancient Doctors who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Creed (and there are many of them) have given any ſuch ſenſe of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>the Catholick Church:</hi> Nay, it was not in the moſt ancient forms of Faith: nor doth the Church truly Catholick teach any thing as neceſſary to be believed to Salvation, but what is contained in the Creed.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94132:142"/>
Rule of Faith, by conſidering particularly the falſity of every one of thoſe Doctrines which they have added to the ancient Creeds. But it will be more proper, in ſo ſhort a Treatiſe as this, only to bring to the Readers mind ſome Principles in the foregoing Books; which direct us as plainly to reject Popery, (and upon the very ſame ground) as thoſe falſe Religions, for whoſe confutation he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges them.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> let the Reader again weigh his Arguments againſt the worſhip of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and he will find them, in ſeveral things, as ſtrong againſt the worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: whoſe practices, it will hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, are no leſs faulty than their Faith. As for example, in the worſhip of Angels, and Saints.</p>
               <p>For the former, They ſhould not only (as he diſcourſes there, <hi>Book</hi> IV.) in their very worſhip make an evident difference between the moſt high God and thoſe Angels to whom they commend themſelves, (which they do not do in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the external acts of adoration have none that are appropriated to God alone, but are all common to him with others; as <hi>adoration, invocation, burning incenſe, nay offering the Sacrifice of the Maſs in their honour, and making vows to them)</hi> but be ſatisfied alſo what order there is among the Angels; what
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94132:143"/>
good may be expected from each of them; and what honour the moſt high God is willing ſhould be beſtowed upon every one of them. All which being wanting; (for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing revealed about ſuch matters) it is plain from thence, how uncertain that Religion is, and how much ſafer it would be for them to betake themſelves, as we do, to the worſhip of Almighty God alone. Eſpecially for that, to whomſoever He is favourable, to them the holy Angels muſt needs be kind and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (though no Petitions be made to them) being the Miniſters and Servants of the moſt High: who hath revealed this to us, that He hath made them all ſubject to Jeſus Chriſt; to be ſent forth by Him, for the good of thoſe who ſhall be heirs of Salvation. In the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which, they, above all others, have reaſon to hope to be, who have ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to His Majeſty, and confidence in his Goodneſs, that for fear of offending Him, they dare worſhip none but Himſelf alone: reſting aſſured, He will deal well with them, even for this reaſon; becauſe they have ſuch a regard to Him, as not to preſume without his warrant and authority, ſo much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelves to Him, by any Angel in Heaven, though never ſo great; but by his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt alone, who is the Head of them all, and whom He hath conſecreated to be our perpetual Interceſſor with Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:94132:143"/>
The like we may ſay of the Worſhip of Saints; to whom all Prayers are fruitleſs and vain, unleſs they be able to do ſomething for their Supplicants. Of which they have no certainty; nor is there more ground to ſay that they can, than that they cannot; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs ground: ſince it is inconceivable how they ſhould be able to hear and aſſiſt ſo many, as addreſs themſelves to the ſame Saint, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral far diſtant parts of the World: without ſuppoſing them to be equal to our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (for they have as many, if not more, Supplicants as He) by ſuch an union as He hath with the Divinity.</p>
               <p>They worſhip alſo, which is ſtill worſe, ſuch for Saints, as never were in being; and others whoſe Saintſhip there is too much reaſon to queſtion, being apparently guilty of ſuch crimes, as are inconſiſtent with it. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, our <hi>Thomas à Becket</hi> (by whoſe bloud, they have prayed our Lord Chriſt, that they may aſcend into Heaven; and do ſtill pray, (upon <hi>Decemb.</hi> 29.) that they who implore his help <hi>may have the ſaving effect of his petitions)</hi> whom our Forefathers, even in the time of Popery, lookt upon as a perjured Perſon, and as a Traitor: being not only called ſo by the King; but in Parliament accuſed of Treaſon, the Biſhops as well as others being preſent; and the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> pronouncing the ſentence againſt him.</p>

               <p>THERE is this Argument alſo againſt it (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> Book 4.

And truly his reaſon in the <hi>Third</hi> Section of the ſame Book againſt the <hi>Paganiſh</hi> worſhip, that it was from evil Spirits, becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated their Worſhippers to deſtroy them that worſhipped one God; holds good ſtill (if there be any force in it) to prove the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church not to be acted by the good Spirit of God; becauſe they would not let thoſe live (had they ſufficient power) who worſhip only one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and content themſelves with the Belief before mentioned, into which they were Baptized; not preſuming to ſuperadd any thing elſe, as neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>And, which is worſe, while they have been moſt cruel to thoſe, who for fear of offending God, dare not allow the worſhip they give to Saints, which they think belongs to him alone; nor fall down before the Sacrament and adore it, as very God Himſelf: They have tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch without any cenſure, who have raiſed St. <hi>Francis</hi> into an equality with, if not ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority unto, our bleſſed Saviour; and made the bleſſed Virgin a kind of Goddeſs; nay called the <hi>Pope</hi> the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords; giving him ſuch a power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Kings and Kingdoms, as ſober Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves are aſhamed to own.

               <p>THAT argument alſo which he urges for Chriſtianity againſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> that the chief Points of Chriſtian Doctrine, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by ſome or other of the beſt and greateſt among them; may be uſed by us alſo for the Faith to which we now hold: there being ſeveral learned Writers in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who have acknowledged our belief to be ſufficient to Salvation; and the Points which they have ſuperadded, having been lookt upon by the moſt excellent Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, only as meer Scholaſtical opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and not certain Truths, of which we can have a full aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Here I might ſhow, how <hi>the ſufficiency of the Scripture</hi> hath been owned; and <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed</hi> likewiſe confeſſed to contain all
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94132:145"/>
things that are abſolutely neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to ſalvation. But becauſe I would not have this Book ſwell above the bigneſs of the foregoing, I ſhall let them alone: and inſtance only in the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which is now preſſed with ſo much violence upon the Chriſtian World; but moſt plainly condemned by <hi>Gratian</hi> in their <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and by the <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Canon of the Maſs</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>About the former we may be ſatisfied out of the <hi>Decretum,</hi> if we look into the <hi>Third</hi> part, and the <hi>ſecond</hi> Diſtinction, concerning <hi>Conſecration.</hi> Where in the XL VIII. Chapter out of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> he ſays, <hi>The heavenly bread, which is truly Chriſts fleſh,</hi> ſuo modo, <hi>after a ſort or manner is called the Body of Chriſt: whereas</hi> revera <hi>in truth it is the Sacrament of his Body, which was hanged upon the Croſs: and the ſacrificing of the fleſh of Chriſt, by the hand of the Prieſt, is called his death, and paſſion, and crucifixion, not in the Truth of the thing, but in a ſignifying myſtery.</hi> Which words are ſo directly againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant can ſpeak more expreſly and clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; nor deſire a plainer confutation of it; unleſs it be that of the <hi>Gloſs</hi> upon thoſe words, which is this: <hi>The celeſtial Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which truly repreſents the fleſh of Chriſt, is ſaid to be the Body of Chriſt; but improperly:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94132:146"/>
whence it is ſaid to be ſo,</hi> ſuo modo, ſed non rei veritate, <hi>after a manner, but not in the truth of the thing. So the ſenſe is, it is called Chriſts body; that is, it is ſignified thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we look further into the LII. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we find he ſaith Chriſt was <hi>ſacrificed but once,</hi> in ſemet ipſo, <hi>in himſelf, when he hung upon the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet is offered daily</hi> in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento, <hi>in the Sacrament, which the Church frequents in memory of that thing.</hi> Which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the next Chapter he calls <hi>exemplum,</hi> the example, or reſemblance of that upon the Croſs, offered in remembrance of his Death. Which is ſufficient to convince us that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in thoſe days, as we do now, and not as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth; elſe He would not have called that, which he ſays was truly the fleſh of Chriſt, the <hi>heavenly bread.</hi> But to put all out of doubt, let us turn to the <hi>lxxii.</hi> Chapter, and there we find theſe remarkable words out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which fully explain the buſineſs, <hi>Becauſe it is not lawful for Chriſt to be devoured by our teeth, therefore our Lord would have this Bread and this Wine in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, by conſecration of the Holy Spirit, to be potentially created his fleſh and blood, and to be daily myſtically offered for the life of the World.</hi> They are <hi>potentially</hi> then or <hi>virtually</hi> made his Body and Blood, though but Bread and Wine in themſelves: <hi>and of this Sacrifice which is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94132:146"/>
thus wonderfully made in commemoration of Christ,</hi> (as he adds out of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> Chap. <hi>lxxvi.) it is lawful to eat;</hi> but <hi>of that which Christ offered on the Croſs,</hi> ſecundum ſe, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it ſelf none can eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>the Canon of the Maſs</hi> will more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly convince us, that he or they that made it, did not believe any thing of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi> For <hi>Firſt,</hi> after the Conſecration of the Bread and Wine, the Prieſt ſigns them <hi>ten</hi> times, at leaſt, with the ſign of the Croſs: which can have no excuſe made for it, (but is the greateſt impudence) if it be indeed <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf who lies before the Prieſt, whom he thus croſſes; For ſure he doth not intend to bleſs <hi>Christ,</hi> or to drive away the Devil from him, or any ſuch like thing, for which thoſe Croſſings are uſed in that Church.</p>
               <p>But more than this, <hi>(2dly,)</hi> it is obſervable, that after Conſecration alſo, the Prieſt ſtill calls Chriſt's Body, <hi>Panem Sanctum,</hi> the holy Bread of Eternal life; which ſhows that, when this <hi>Rule</hi> was made, they believed the Bread to be ſtill remaining.</p>
               <p>A further Indication of which, is, that <hi>(3dly)</hi> the Prieſt proceeds to beſeech God, that He would vouchſafe to look upon that Sacrifice <hi>of his gifts,</hi> with a propitious and ferene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and to accept them, as He did the gift of his Servant <hi>Abel,</hi> and the Sacrifice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that which his High-Prieſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94132:147"/>
                  <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> offered to Him. Which is moſt abſurdly ſpoken, if the Prieſt there offer Chriſt himſelf unto God; For then he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes with him for our Interceſſor, as if he needed our Prayers: and beſides, compares Him with the firſt-fruits of the Flock, and the ſpoils of War; which is ſo incongruous, and ſo much below his heavenly glory, that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Man cannot but think, they who compoſed that Prayer, looked upon thoſe gifts which they offered, as ſtill Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>Which appears more fully <hi>(4thly)</hi> from what follows in the next Prayer, where, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profoundly, and laying his hands upon the Altar, the Prieſt humbly intreats God in this manner; <hi>Command theſe things to be carried by the hands of thy holy Angel, to thy high Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, into the preſence of thy Divine Majeſty.</hi> Where there are two plain teſtimonies againſt their preſent doctrine. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> nothing but the Bread and Wine can be called <hi>haec</hi> theſe things; which in no propriety of ſpeech can ſignifie the very natural body of Chriſt. Who <hi>(ſecondly)</hi> can by none of God's Angels be carried into Heaven, being there already; nor brought more than He is into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Divine Majeſty, where He was before the Prieſt ſaid Maſs, and ſits for ever there at God's right hand.</p>
               <p>Had they that compoſed this Prayer believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> they would
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94132:147"/>
have ſaid, (and could not have ſaid otherways, if they ſaid any thing of this matter) <hi>Almighty God, behold here, before me upon thy Altar, lies thy only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, by my ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto Thee: that very Chriſt who is at thy right hand, I now take into my hands to preſent unto thy Majeſty, under the form of Bread and Wine. Him thou canſt not reject, nor me his Prieſt, who offer Him unto Thee, &amp;c.</hi> Or ſome ſuch like words, more befitting their preſent notions, than deſiring an Angel may carry what the Prieſt offers, and preſent it unto GOD.</p>
               <p>But we find quite contrary, which is the <hi>laſt</hi> thing I ſhall obſerve, that in concluſion, the Prieſt acknowledges, that by Chriſt Jeſus God always <hi>creates, and ſanctifies and quickens, and bleſſes</hi> (making a croſs upon the Hoſt and the Chalice, at every one of thoſe <hi>three</hi> laſt words) <hi>all theſe good things.</hi> Which can be meant of nothing but the Bread and Wine conſecrated to the commemoration and repreſentation of Chriſt's body and bloud ſacrificed for us. For Chriſt's own very natural body and bloud can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any tolerable ſenſe, be ſaid to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually created and quickned, or made alive: unleſs you will ſuppoſe him to have been dead before, nay not to have been at all. For <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> implies the thing not to have been; and <hi>vivification,</hi> not to have been then alive, when it was quickned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:94132:148"/>
Yet this fancy, <hi>of Chriſts real preſence in the Sacrament, by Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> againſt which there are ſuch numerous Teſtimonies in their own Communion Service, is now become the main Article of their Religion. For we all know, to our great grief and aſtoniſhment, that when the publick Authority of this Realm was on their ſide, ſubſcription was not urged to any Article of their Religion upon ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and bloudy terms, as unto this of the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi> The Myſtery of which iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a great Man of our own ſaid, in the Age before us, cannot be better reſolved than into the powerful and deceitful working of Satan; who delights thus to do deſpite to our Lord, and to his Religion; by ſeducing his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Subjects into a belief of ſuch things as make them and Him ridiculous unto unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and ingage them in the worſt kind of Rebellion, he could imagine, by worſhipping Bread and Wine inſtead of their Saviour: and all this upon the leaſt occaſions and ſhalloweſt reaſons.</p>

               <p>BUT beſides theſe plain confeſſions of that Church againſt it ſelf, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94132:148"/>
other things, (which I ſhall but juſt name) wherein we have the teſtimony of ſeveral of their own learned Men (ready to be produced) for our, and againſt their belief: proving clearly that the preſent, is not the old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of that Church; but that they have brought into it many Innovations: <hi>by adding to the Canonical Books of Scripture; by making their vulgar Latine Tranſlation of the Bible</hi> (about which they themſelves cannot agree) <hi>authentical; by forbidding the People to read the holy Scriptures in their own Language; and by denying them the publick Prayers in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they underſtand; by giving the Pope, not only a new Title of Univerſal Biſhop, but an authority and juriſdiction, which was never heard of for many Ages; by increaſing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sacraments, and altering their nature; by taking away the Cup from the People; and turning the Sacrament of Chriſts body and bloud into a proper expiatory ſacrifice; by celebrating the Euchariſt, without any body to communicate; by ſetting up Images in Churches, and ordaining Religious Worſhip to be given to them; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating Saints and Angels;</hi> (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>and by the Doctrine of Purgatory, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and many other; together with a vaſt number of ſtrange ceremonies, in the making holy water, conſecrating bells,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:94132:149"/>
The woful effect of which is this (if we may ſpeak the plain Truth) that by preſſing upon Mens belief a great deal too much, and placing great vertue in trifles, they have tempted Men to believe nothing at all. As is apparent from hence; that where and when (as an excellent Writer of our own ſpeaks) this Religion hath moſt abſolutely commanded, there and then Atheiſm or Infidelity hath moſt abounded. And how ſhould it do otherwiſe? when, as he obſerves, ſo many lying Legends have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon Mens belief, and ſo many falſe Miracles forged to juſtifie them, as are very likely to make ſuſpicious Men queſtion the truth of all: And ſo many weak and frivolous ceremonies deviſed, and ſuch abundance of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous obſervances in Religion introduced, as are no leſs apt to beget a ſecret contempt and ſcorn of it in witty Men: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Atheiſm and Impiety; if they have this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion ſetled in their mind (which is indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be rooted in them from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) that if they be not of that Religion, they were as good be of none at all: And when a great part alſo of the Doctrines now mentioned, ſo apparently make for the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ends of thoſe who teach them; that ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Men can ſcarce forbear thinking, they were on purpoſe deviſed to ſerve thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: That particular doctrine alſo of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> being ſo portentous, that joyned
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94132:149"/>
with the forenamed perſwaſion, of <hi>No Papiſts no Chriſtians,</hi> it hath in all probability brought more than <hi>Averroes</hi> to this reſolution; <hi>ſince Chriſtians eat that which they adore, let my Soul be among the Philoſophers:</hi> And <hi>laſtly,</hi> the pretence which is ſo common, that there is no ground to believe the Scriptures, but their Churches infallibility; and yet no ground to believe their Churches infallibility, but ſome Texts of Scripture; being too plain a way to lead thoſe who diſcern the labyrinth wherein they are, to believe neither Church nor Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XIV.</hi> Whereby they have ſpoil'd Chriſtianity, as the Pagans did the Natural Religion.</head>
               <p>THESE things, which have been already urged by the Writers of our Church, for the conviction of thoſe who are capable of it, I repeat here again; becauſe they ſeem to me very powerful for the preſervation of thoſe, who are not already tainted, or too far gone in that deluſion. Which is ſo great, that (to ſumm up all belonging to this Head) we may ſafely ſay, <hi>Popery</hi> is juſt ſuch a deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true Chriſtian Religion, as <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:94132:150"/>
was of the Natural Religion. There cannot be a righter conception of it, than this; which appears too plainly, in the abſurd do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and opinions, which they have mingled with the Chriſtian Faith; in their multiplied ſuperſtitions; in their fabulous relations of the Saints, wherein they have ſurpaſſed the very <hi>Poets</hi> themſelves; and (to paſs by the reſt) in their proſtrating themſelves before Images; and giving religious worſhip to Men departed.</p>
               <p>Which laſt inſtance, furniſhed the Pagans of <hi>Cochin</hi> with this anſwer to the Jeſuits (as <hi>Chriſtoph. Borrus,</hi> one of that Order, relates) when they preſſed upon them the belief of one God, and no more. We do believe it, ſaid they; but thoſe whom you ſee us worſhip in their Images, were Men of great Sanctity; whom pious People therefore worſhip accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merit, juſt as you give to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Martyrs and Confeſſors divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of honour and religious ſervice, as you know them to have excelled in vertue and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that they might confirm this to be their ſenſe of the Divinity, they bid the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites obſerve one part of the Altar in their Temple to be void of Images, and to be hid in an obſcure and dark place; which they ſaid was the proper ſeat of the moſt high God, the Maker of Heaven and Earth, who could not be repreſented in any form and ſhape:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94132:150"/>
and that the Images which ſtood about that place were the repreſentations of their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors with Him; who having great power with the moſt high God, did obtain many gifts and bleſſings for thoſe that invocated them. How this differs from the notions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I do not ſee; unleſs it be in this, that they have ſometimes adventured to repreſent God himſelf in a ſhape. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the worſhip is the very ſame (the dead Men, who are the objects of it, only changed) and may very well juſtifie us, if we ſay, (and therein we ſpeak very moderately) <hi>that their worſhip is an Image, at leaſt, of the ancient Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> And moves them (to make the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance more perfect) unto the very ſame rage and violence, which was in the Pagans, againſt all thoſe that differ from them, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to worſhip God in that way: proſecuting them with all manner of cruelty, as if they were utter enemies of God, and of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>By which we may certainly know that they are ſo far from being the only true Chriſtians, that they are a very degenerate part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church: wanting that great mark of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſciples, <hi>to love one another, even as Chriſt loved us.</hi> To which they are ſuch ſtrangers, that quite contrary, they not only hate and perſecute, but endeavour, as I ſaid, to root out thoſe from the face of the Earth; who
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94132:151"/>
obediently believe all that they can find our Lord and his Apoſtles have delivered; and profeſs they are ready with all their hearts to receive and do, whatſoever any body can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach them, to be his mind: Nay, are very deſirous and diligent to know it; ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no pains to underſtand the whole Truth, as it is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XV.</hi> Anſwer to what they ſay about Miracles.</head>
               <p>THEY pretend indeed abundance of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought in their Church, as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient condemnation of thoſe who obſtinately refuſe to invocate Saints, to worſhip their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and the conſecrated Hoſte, to believe Purgatory and all other things, for the proof of which theſe wonders are alledged. But herein alſo they imitate the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who were guilty of the like deceit: and the ſame anſwer will ſerve here, which <hi>Grotius</hi> gives there <hi>(L.</hi> iv. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.) in his confutation of the old Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> the wiſeſt Men among them have rejected many of theſe Miracles, as not ſupported by the teſtimony of any credible witneſſes; nay, as plain fictions. Others alſo of them, which are pretended to be of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94132:151"/>
better credit, hapned in ſome private place, in the night, before one or two Perſons: whoſe eyes crafty Prieſts (as he ſpeaks) might eaſily delude with falſe ſhows and counterfeit appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of things. And further, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which only raiſe admiration among Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ignorant of the nature of things; and are no true miracles.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but there may have things been done among them, which no humane power could effect by the ſtrength of natural cauſes; and yet no Divine, that is, omnipotent Power be needful to their production. For thoſe Spirits, which are interpoſed between God and Man, are able by their nimbleneſs, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, activity, and ſtrength to make ſuch ſtrange application of things (very diſtant) one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſhall aſtoniſh the Spectators with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects. But there is too great reaſon to think they are not good Spirits, that do theſe feats; becauſe they revive hereby the ancient ſuperſtition, or uphold the Image of it ſtill in the Chriſtian World; to the great diſhonour of our Saviour, and the indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of his People. Who have been ſo far miſled, as not only to fancy great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Images of the Saints; and to cry up alſo ſome Images, particularly of our Lady (of <hi>Loretto</hi> for inſtance) as indued with ſome ſingular power and vertue, which is not to be found in others: but to honour them ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94132:152"/>
as for one Miracle ſaid to be done by a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,</hi> to report a hundred to be wrought at ſuch or ſuch a Shrine of hers.</p>
               <p>It is very conſiderable alſo (to omit the reſt) which he notes, in the V. Book, out of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that it ſuppoſes God might permit ſome wonders to be done, only for their trial; whether the People would perſiſt in the worſhip of the true God; which had been confirmed by undoubted and far greater and more numerous Miracles. Read <hi>Deuteron.</hi> xiii. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is excellently expreſſed, and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by a great Man of our own; in theſe words, or to this effect. The Doctrine which we believe, that is, the Bible, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as is confeſſed on all ſides, by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſupernatural and truly Divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and conſequently the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which in many points is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to the Bible, is condemned by them: I mean the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And therefore if any ſtrange things have been done in that Church, they prove nothing but the truth of Scripture: which foretold, that (God's Providence permitting it, and the wickedneſs of the World deſerving it) <hi>ſtrange ſigns, and wonders ſhould be wrought, to confirm falſe doctrine; that they which love not the Truth might be given over to ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions.</hi> So that now we have reaſon rather to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94132:152"/>
ſuſpect and be afraid of pretended Miracles, as ſigns of falſe Doctrine; than much to regard them, as certain arguments of Truth. <hi>Neither is it ſtrange, that God ſhould permit ſome true wonders to be done, to delude thoſe who have forged ſo many wonders, to deceive the World.</hi>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94132:153"/>
I would make this Book as ſhort as the reſt) and only obſerve, in anſwer to what was now pretended; that whoſoever ſhall conſider (as he ſpeaks of the Anceſtors of the <hi>Jews)</hi> what kind of Men for ſeveral Ages ſate in the Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how ignorant the People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally were; he cannot wonder at the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which we complain.</p>
               <p>Let him but read, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the cenſures which their own Authors have paſſed upon ſeveral <hi>Popes,</hi> as meer Epicures, and Men void of all Religion, &amp;c. And then the bitter complaints which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf makes (and that while he wrote to a Pope) of the Vices which were then annexed, even to the very <hi>Papacy:</hi> and further, the deſcription which ſuch Men, as <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> make of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole Body of which, he ſaith, was ſo infected, by the plenitude of power, which is allowed to the Pope, that it might be more truly called a ſhop of Traffique, nay a Den of Thieves, than a Church of Chriſt: and (to come nearer to our own times) the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their People, even ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to worſhip Men as Saints; before they were canonized by the Pope: and he will not think there hath been always ſuch care and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſed about that and ſuch like matters, as they would have us believe.</p>
               <p>We have a memorable inſtance of this thing laſt mentioned (to meddle with no other) in

the Founder of the Jeſuits Order, <hi>Ignatius Loiola:</hi> by whoſe merits People recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to God (if we may believe the Pope himſelf) before he was declared to be a Saint. So <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. informs us in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Decretal Letters</hi> for his Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation: where ſeveral miraculous Works are ſaid to have been done for thoſe, who fled to his help, and religiouſly worſhipped his Image, and commended themſelves to him (as the words are) with all their heart. He was made indeed a <hi>Beato</hi> by the preceding Pope: But the like ſtories are told of <hi>Xavier,</hi> one of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> his Companions, unto whoſe interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the People applied themſelves, and hoped in his merits (as the <hi>Bull</hi> for his Sainting tells us) even before he was made a <hi>Beato.</hi> So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding prone they have been of late to run into Superſtition; as they were more long ago in the days of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who broke down an Altar, which had been ſet up by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Biſhops themſelves, in honour of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, as the People called him: who proved to be no better than a <hi>Highway-man</hi> (as St. <hi>Martin</hi> diſcovered) that had been executed for his Robberies, and there buried.</p>

And then it was eaſie to lead them any whither, when they had for ſaken the Light which ſhowed them their way: and began alſo to place Religion, not in purity of mind, but in Rites and Ceremonies; and to content themſelves with ſuch things, as ſerved rather to exerciſe the Body, than to amend the Soul.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, that falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and an <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> ſprang up both together, very near the ſame time: as <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> ſetled themſelves alſo together at the ſame time in the Age following.

               <p>IF we look further into what was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> we ſhall find that <hi>Popery</hi> ſtands, and upholds it ſelf, by the very ſame ſhameful means, which keep up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of that falſe Prophet. By force, that is, and violence: compelling Men, where they have any power, to conſent to what they ſay, or rather to feign a conſent to what they do not believe. Which diſcovers the weakneſs of that Religion, and of the reaſons of thoſe that profeſs it: For he that extorts aſſent (as was ſaid in the Book foregoing) by ſenſe of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94132:155"/>
pain, or fear of puniſhment; plainly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by that very proceeding, that he diſtruſts his Arguments.</p>
               <p>At the beſt, they require belief of Men, without all liberty of inquiring into Religion. For the vulgar (juſt as in <hi>Turky)</hi> are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to read the Books which are accounted holy: which is a manifeſt ſign of its iniquity (as he there ſpeaks of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion;) for juſtly may that merchandize be ſuſpected, which is obtruded upon this condition; that it muſt not be lookt into, not examined. This is the way of the groſſeſt deceivers; who will not ſubmit themſelves to a trial, and refuſe to give any account: but will have us ſubmit to their Authority, and take, what ſuch Men as they ſay, upon truſt. Which is the Method of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who are wont to put <hi>doubting of any part of their doctrine</hi> among mortal ſins: And ſo, for fear what the iſſue may be, will not ſuffer their People to try their Religion; with indifference, that is, with true liberty of judgment, and with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to doubt of it, if the grounds of it appear upon examination to be uncertain, and to leave it, if they prove apparently falſe.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed (as it there follows) there is not in every Man the like capacity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and quickſightedneſs to diſcern between truth and falſhood: Many alſo are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into error by pride; others by inordinate
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94132:155"/>
paſſions or affections; and ſome by cuſtome and imitation, or by the weakneſs of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and forwardneſs to judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due conſideration, or advice with their proper Guides. But thoſe very Books, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church pretends may miſlead Men (and therefore will not let them uſe) teach them in the firſt and principal place to purge themſelves from all naughty affections; and then to be ſober-minded, and not too forward to determine things on their own heads; but to reverence their judgments, who are over them in the Lord: and not to pretend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor imagine they can judge a-right, till they be humble, and meek, and without any other deſign, than this alone of ſaving their Souls. Now the Divine Goodneſs forbids us to think, that ſuch Men ſhall not be able to find the way to eternal Salvation, who ſeek for it in God's own Word, and in this manner; without any by-reſpect to honour or worldly advantage; and, with intire ſubmiſſion of themſelves and all they have to Him, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his aſſiſtance, that they may attain it. Which are in effect, the very words of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly, ſince GOD hath implanted in Mens minds the power and faculty of judging; there is no part of truth that better deſerves the imployment of this faculty about it, than that of which we cannot be ignorant without

After this, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inquires with a godly mind, he ſhall not dangerouſly erre: And where ſhould he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after it, but in God's moſt holy Word? without which we cannot know whether there be either Church or Prieſt or any thing elſe, wherein they would have us truſt.</p>

               <p>IT is a manifeſt ſign therefore of impoſture, that, when they cannot for ſhame, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffer their Religion to be tried, yet they will not have it tried by the holy Scriptures: <hi>In the reading of which</hi> (as was excellently ſaid in the concluſion of the foregoing Books) <hi>no man can be deceived, but he who hath firſt deceived himſelf.</hi> For the Writers of them were more faithful, and fuller of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, than either to defraud us of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Divine Truth; or to hide it in a Cloud, ſo that we cannot ſee it.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould any body decline this way of trial? unleſs they ſee themſelves ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly condemned by the holy Scriptures; that they dare not let their cauſe be brought into ſo clear a light. Which hurts indeed ſore

eyes; but comforts and delights thoſe that are ſound: ſhowing us ſo plainly what we are to embrace and what to refuſe, and being ſo ſure and ſo perfect a Guide in all ſuch matters; that S. <hi>Hilary</hi> not only commends and admires the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> for deſiring a Faith, according to what was written: But ſaith, <hi>He is an Antichriſt who refuſes this; and an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema that counterfeits it.</hi> And thereupon calls to him, in this manner; <hi>O Emperour, thou ſeekeſt for faith; hearken to it, not out of new little Papers, but of the Books of God.</hi> There we muſt ſeek for it, if we mean to find it: and if they be ſilent and can tell us nothing (ſays St. <hi>Ambroſe)</hi> who ſhall dare to ſpeak?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us not therefore bring deceitful ballances</hi> (they are the words of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his <hi>ſecond</hi> Book of Baptiſm, Chap. vi.) <hi>wherein we may weigh what we liſt, and as we liſt, after our own liking; ſaying, This is heavy, that is light: But let us bring the Divine Ballance, out of the holy Scriptures (as out of the Lords Treaſures) and in that let us weigh what is moſt ponderous: or rather let not us weigh, but acknowledge thoſe things, which are already weighed by the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Yes, ſay they of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we will be put into that Ballance, and tryed by the Scriptures; but not by them alone. Which is, in effect, to refuſe to be tried by them: for they give teſtimony to their own fulneſs, and perfection and plainneſs too, in things

neceſſary; and ſo do all other Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ſucceeded the Apoſtles; who do not ſend us to turn over we know not how many other Volumes, but tell us here we may be abundantly ſatisfied. In ſo much that the firſt Chriſtian Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (the Father of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> now mentioned) admoniſhed the Biſhops in the famous Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with theſe heavenly inſpired Writings, as their Guide and Rule in all their Debates; becauſe <hi>they perſpicuouſly inſtruct us</hi> (as his very words are) <hi>what to believe in divine things, and therefore they ought,</hi> he told them, <hi>to fetch from thence, the Reſolution of thoſe things, which ſhould come in queſtion.</hi> To which Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed is pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> truly was <hi>a Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but no great Doctor:</hi> But as herein he ſpeaks too ſcornfully of him; ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects no leſs upon the underſtanding and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe venerable Fathers aſſembled in that Council, which (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory) was compoſed of Men excelling in Apoſtolical gifts, and many of them carried in their bodies the marks of the Lord Jeſus, and were, for the far greater part, a Multitude of Martyrs aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: who all conſented unto, and followed this wholſome counſel of the Emperour: (as he there teſtifies) knowing he did but ſpeak the ſenſe of the truly Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:94132:157"/>
Which did not meerly bid Men hear it, and bring all doctrines to its touchſtone: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed plainly that even the Church it ſelf muſt be tried by the Scriptures. It is the expreſs ſentence of the ſame S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>

The Lords Books there are certainly; to whoſe. authority we both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we both believe, we both yield obedience: there let us ſeek the Church; there let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs our cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to name no more, the Author of the imperfect work upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> (carrying the name of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> declares this ſo fully, that it leaves no doubt in us, what courſe they took for ſatisfaction in this buſineſs. <hi>Heretofore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there were many ways, whereby one might know what was the true Church of Christ; and what was Gentiliſm: but now there is no way to know what is the true Church of Christ, but by the Scriptures. Why ſo? Becauſe all thoſe things which belong
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94132:158"/>
properly to Christ in truth and reality; thoſe hereſies have alſo in ſhow and in appearance. They have Scriptures, Baptiſm, Eucharist, and all the reſt, even Chriſt himſelf; like as we have. Therefore if any one would know which is the true Church of Chriſt; how ſhould he know it, in ſuch a confuſion of multitude, but only by the Scriptures?</hi> which he repeats over again a little after, <hi>he therefore that would know which is the true Church of Chriſt, how ſhould he know it, but by the Scriptures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To them let us go, and in them let us reſt: and if you are the Diſciples of the Goſpel, may we ſay to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> does to the Followers of <hi>Apolinarius,</hi> in his Book about the <hi>Incarnation of Chriſt)</hi> 
                  <q>Do not ſpeak unrighteouſly againſt the Lord, but walk in what is written and done. But if you will talk of different things from what are written, why do you contend with us; who dare not hear nor ſpeak, beſide thoſe things which are written? Our Lord telling us, <hi>if you abide in the word, even in my word, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> What immodeſt frenzy is this, to ſpeak things, which are not written? and to deviſe things which are ſtrangers to piety?</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which, if we faithfully adhere, there is this to be added for our incouragement; that though we ſhould miſtake in the ſenſe of the Scriptures yet they ſecure us, that if we with
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94132:158"/>
honeſt and upright hearts continue to inquire after the truth, (deſigning nothing elſe) that error ſhall not prejudice us: But God will either diſcover to us his mind, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for our error of weakneſs, not of wilfulneſs.</p>

               <p>AS for Interpretations of Scripture by Tradition, they may be pretended and talkt of; but cannot be produced in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where we are deſirous of that help: which we gladly receive, when we can have it by a truly Univerſal conſent. But as for particular interpretations of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they do not abſolutely agree with each other, in their Expoſitions of thoſe Texts, upon which controverſies of greateſt moment are now grounded. Nay, they oft times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound divers interpretations alike probable. And ſometimes plainly intimate their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and make but imperfect conjectures; in ſuch a manner, as if they intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Poſterity to ſeek for further reſolution. Therefore we ſhall not diſſent from them, though we do not aſſent to all their particular
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94132:159"/>
interpretations. Nay, we cannot more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them, than by following their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations on ſuch ſtrict terms as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> would bind us all to do; when they ſeem to make for their advantage. For then, there is not the leaſt ſurmiſe or conjecture of any one Father, but muſt ſuffice againſt the joynt Authority of all the reſt. To which Rule (of ſerving their intereſt) they are ſo true, that they ſtick not to reject any interpretation of the Fathers, when they think good: and, which is more, to prefer their own expoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theirs.</p>
               <p>And ſo they do in the matter of all other Traditions, though called Apoſtolical. For inſtance, the threefold immerſion in Baptiſm, <hi>which ſeems to have flowed from an Apoſtolical Canon, is long ago aboliſhed</hi> (ſaith their <hi>Canus) by a contrary cuſtome.</hi> And ſo is the cuſtome of giving the communion to Infants (which prevailed, ſays their <hi>Maldonate,</hi> for 600. Years in the Church) not only antiquated by them, but decreed to be unlawful. Which clearly ſhows that they might, if they pleaſed, make an end of all the controverſies that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Church; without any diſparagement (but rather with the increaſe) of its Authority. For challenging a power to alter even the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt, (as they have done in taking away the Cup from the People in the Holy Communion) and much more thoſe of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94132:159"/>
the Apoſtles: what need all this ſtir about A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Traditions, or the Decrees of the Church? which they may lay aſide at their pleaſure; and have laid aſide, as appears by many other inſtances, beſides thoſe now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that may be given of it.</p>
               <p>But it is ſufficient for the direction of every honeſt hearted Man to know (which is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as any thing of that nature can be, and may be undoubtedly relyed on) that nothing is clearer in the Tradition of the Church than this: that the Doctors of it declare the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be full and perſpicuous in all needful matters. And therefore, there needs no other Tradition, but the Tradition of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: which ſatisfie us abundantly, in the Truth of all thoſe things which are univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received.</p>

               <p>THERE cannot therefore be a greater demonſtration of their guilt than this, that notwithſtanding ſuch evident teſtimonies from the Scriptures themſelves, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current ſtream of the ancient Doctors of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94132:160"/>
Chriſt's Church; they have been forced (to avoid this trial by the Scriptures) to ſay ſo many ſcandalous things as they have done, in diſparagement of the Sacred Writings. Many of them are commonly known, and I am not willing to repeat the reſt; but only ſay this great truth: that whether they will or no, their Church, ſuch as it is, receives all its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Scriptures, and not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures from it. For we can have no notion, as was ſaid before, of a Church, or of its authority; but from the Scriptures. Which therefore muſt be of greater authority, than that which receives authority from them, and be firſt ſuppoſed to be infallible, before they can make us believe any thing elſe is ſo. For we muſt be ſecure of the proof before we can be ſure of the thing proved by it; otherwiſe it is no proof, but leaves us as much in doubt as we were before it was alledged.</p>
               <p>If they ſay (and what elſe can be ſaid, with any colour of reaſon?) that we muſt indeed learn their Churches infallibility from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; but then learn the reſt from their Church: mark, I beſeech you, what follows. Then it is manifeſt, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that they themſelves make the Scriptures the Rule of Faith, in this one Article, at leaſt, concerning the Catholick Churches infallibility. Which we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe (and for no other reaſon) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94132:160"/>
the Scriptures which we firſt infallibly believe, do teach and prove it.</p>
               <p>Whence it plainly follows that private Men may, and muſt be aſſured of the Truth of Scriptures (without the help of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Authority) before they can believe any thing elſe: becauſe it is the ground for their belief of that infallibility which their Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; which to them is the General Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>And from thence it follows further, that the Scriptures, which to us are the only Rule of Faith, ought to be acknowledged by them to be more than ſo; even the Rule of their Rule of Faith. And if it be ſo; what reaſon can any Man alledge, why it ſhould not be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Rule of Faith (without ſending us elſewhere to ſeek it) in all other Articles of the Creed, as well as in that of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infallible Church.</p>
               <p>We may appeal to all the World, and call Heaven and Earth, Angels and Men to witneſs, between us and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Champion of our Cauſe did long ago) whether the Articles of Chriſt's Incarnation, his Death, Paſſion, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, Interceſſion, the Reſurrection of the Dead, and life everlaſting, &amp;c. be not much more plainly ſet down in the Scriptures, to any Mans apprehenſion whatſoever; than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94132:161"/>
ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> or any other from whence they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it. And therefore why ſhould we be required to learn theſe, or any other part of Chriſtian Faith meerly from their Church, when we learn them ſo eaſily by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in which they are to be found more clearly delivered, than any thing we read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Church?</p>
               <p>Let no Man doubt, but if the Holy Ghoſt will teach us that Article of the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, immediately by the Scriptures without the help of the Churches infallible Authority (as they themſelves are forced to confeſs, becauſe elſe the Church can have no authority;) then He will immediately teach us by the ſame Scriptures, any other Article of our Creed, and whatſoever is neceſſary to Salvation, which are plainly and perſpicuouſly enough ſet down in the Scriptures; without the help and aſſiſtance of the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible authority, which the Scriptures cannot be ſuppoſed to teach, but by places far more doubtful.</p>

But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.</hi> Let that be his Guide, who would not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray in dangerous Paths; into which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall, who keeps cloſe to the directions of the Holy Books: wherein all neceſſary Truth being ſet down, as the moſt ancient and beſt Doctors unanimouſly agree, we are certain (every way) by believing them, to believe all neceſſary Truth; and if our lives be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly (without which, they tell us, our belief will be vain) it is impoſſible we ſhould fail of everlaſting Salvation.</p>
               <p>To theſe alone (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> ſpeaks for himſelf, in his Book of <hi>Nature and Grace)</hi> we owe an abſolute conſent, without refuſing any thing they propound to us. <hi>Whatſoever it be</hi> (as his words are in his CXII. Epiſtle) <hi>that is confirmed by the perſpicuous authority of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94132:162"/>
the divine Scriptures, thoſe,</hi> viz. <hi>which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical in the Church; it muſt be believed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any doubting. But as for any other witneſſes or teſtimonies, to which thou art perſwaded to give credit; thou mayeſt believe them, or not believe them, according as thou perceiveſt them to deſerve or not deſerve to be relied on.</hi> A great reverence is due to the Church and its teſtimony (though leſs to the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than others; becauſe it hath ſo groſly abuſed the World by falſe records, and forged Miracles, and ſuch like things) yet only as to an humane Teſtimony; which cannot equal that of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XXIII.</hi> Which have more manifeſt notes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty than the Church.</head>
               <p>FOR if we take their own way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to aſſure our minds that we follow an infallible Guide, there is no <hi>note</hi> which they give of the true Church, which they ſay ought to be our Guide; but pleads far more ſtrongly for the Holy Scriptures, that we ſhould rather follow them, and give an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted credit to them. I ſhall not run over all thoſe <hi>Notes,</hi> nor examine the certainty of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94132:162"/>
them; but only briefly name ſome of them and ſhow, that if they prove any thing, it is the Authority of the Scriptures above the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> they ſay, the very <hi>name of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> is venerable, and ought to be regarded. But, as that Name is not proper to them alone, ſo, if there be any power in Names to make us reſpect any thing; what more awful than the Name of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> which were always given to theſe Books, to which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe all Chriſtians to adhere.</p>
               <p>The next Note, which is <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is on the ſide of the Scriptures alſo; which more juſtly claim to be ancienter than all other Books, which pretend to any Divinity; than the Catholick Church can claim to be ancienter than all other Societies, which call themſelves by the Name of a Church. Nay, the Doctrine contained therein, muſt be ſuppoſed, as I have ſhown, to be before the Church; which is made by belief and profeſſion of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and the Old Teſtament certainly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, long before the Church was made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>unity,</hi> in that the Church is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Scriptures, whoſe agreement and conſent of parts is admirable. And if we ſpeak of the ſureſt bond of true <hi>Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> it is as manifeſt as the <hi>Sun,</hi> that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> lay
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94132:163"/>
the foundation of it, and preſerve us in it (if we adhere to them) by keeping us cloſe to <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm:</hi> but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath uſurped the Name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> makes this bleſſed Unity impoſſible. For, there being but two ways to it, either that we all agree in our Opinions about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or that while we differ it be no hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Communion; they have made the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as impoſſible as the former: becauſe they make it abſolutely neceſſary to communion and ſalvation, to believe in every thing as they do.</p>
               <p>The like might be ſaid of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> of Doctrine (which depends upon the Churches ſpeaking according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) <hi>ſanctity of the authors</hi> of our Religion (which cannot be known but out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) the <hi>glory of Miracles,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and all the reſt: but I ſhall only touch upon one more, the <hi>Amplitude</hi> and <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality</hi> of the Church, in which they make their boaſt. But herein the Scriptures moſt evidently excel; their Authority being there ſacred, where the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (whoſe Notes theſe are) is not known, or not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For all Chriſtians in the World, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Sect they be, believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God: whereas they alone ſay, that they are the only true Church of God. All Chriſtians beſides, who know any
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94132:163"/>
thing of this pretence of theirs, abſolutely deny it; and maintain the Divinity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures, againſt all their Cavils.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XXIV.</hi> The great incouragement we have to do ſo.</head>
               <p>BY following the Scriptures then, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſureſt Guide by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. For <hi>firſt,</hi> by following the Scriptures, we are certainly led by God; but by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, we are only led by Men. And conſequently the Faith we build upon the Scriptures is a <hi>Divine</hi> Faith; but the Faith we build upon the authority of the Church meerly, can be no more than <hi>humane.</hi> For the Scriptures are fully and amply proved to be of Divine Authority, by all thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are alledged in the <hi>Third</hi> Book of this Work: the like to which cannot be produced to prove the infallible authority of the Church. Which cannot ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that God hath bid us believe it, but by ſending us to the Holy Scriptures; from whence it derives all its Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:94132:164"/>
Which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing to be conſidered (and here I will take the liberty to tranſcribe part of the diſcourſe of a great Man on this Subject, with ſome Additions) that by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, we follow that which they themſelves are forced to follow (as was noted before) and on which they intirely depend, for the proof of their own authority; on which they would have us intirely depend. Who have reaſon rather to rely, on that which they rely: and in ſo doing tacitely confeſs the Scriptures are of greateſt authority; and that they are ſurer of their Truth, than of the Churches Infallibility.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by following the Scriptures, we follow that which muſt be true, if their Church (which they would have us follow) have any truth in it; for their Church cannot but give atteſtation to them: whereas, if we follow their Church we muſt follow that, which, though the Scriptures be true, may be falſe; nay, which, if the Scriptures be true, muſt be falſe, becauſe the Scriptures teſtifie againſt it.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>(4thly)</hi> to follow the Scriptures, we have God's expreſs Warrant, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; without any colour for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition: but to believe their Church infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, we have no commandment, much leſs
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94132:164"/>
any expreſs Commandment; nay, have reaſon to think, we are prohibited ſo to do in ſuch words as thoſe, <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets. Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God,</hi> &amp;c. Which require us to examine before we truſt; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to give up our ſelves blindfold to thoſe who confidently claim the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> but cannot produce any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>(5thly)</hi> by following the Scriptures, we ſhall keep to that which was always belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and every where received: But by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we ſhall make our ſelves guilty of the changes and alterations which they have made (as another great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of our Church hath obſerved) <hi>in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Creed,</hi> (by making a new one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining things that hold no conformity with the Apoſtles) and in the <hi>Apoſtolical ſucceſſion</hi> (by ingroſſing the whole ſucceſſion to <hi>Rome,</hi> and making other Biſhops to be but the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Deputies, as to their Juriſdiction) and in the <hi>Apoſtolical Government</hi> (by erecting a new and Univerſal Monarchy in the Church) and laſtly in the <hi>Apoſtolical Communion,</hi> by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the greateſt part of the holy Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>By <hi>(6thly)</hi> following the <hi>Roman</hi> Church alſo,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94132:165"/>
we ſhall be bound to hold many things, not only above Reaſon, but againſt it: whereas by following the Scriptures, we ſhall only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome Myſteries, but no impoſſibilities, ſome things above reaſon, but nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. For, though there be things in Scripture, which had they not been revealed, reaſon could not have diſcovered; yet there is nothing there, which being revealed, can by true reaſon be confuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(7thly)</hi> Contrary to fleſh and blood indeed there are many things contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; &amp; therefore by following them, we ſhall believe a Religion, which notwithſtanding that great prejudice which Men had to it, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inlarged it ſelf over the World in a ſhort time; without any aſſiſtance from worldly power, wit or policy; nay, againſt all theſe: whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath got all its Authority over Mens Conſciences, by no other means, than by deviſing falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, falſe Miracles and Reports (as was ſaid before) and by complying with Mens corrupt affections, or by perſecuting thoſe that would not comply; and by all other ſuch like world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means, whether of policy or force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(8thly)</hi> To which add, that by following the Scriptures, we ſhall believe a Religion, whoſe firſt Preachers and Profeſſors could have no
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94132:165"/>
worldly ends to ſerve (as hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the foregoing Books) but rather were to expect, as they every where found, nothing but diſgrace, vile nay cruel uſage, by all manner of puniſhments: whereas the head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it is even palpable, makes their Religion the Inſtrument of his Ambition, and ſeeks thereby to intitle himſelf, directly or indirectly, to the Monarchy of the World: And beſides, it is evident to him that hath but half an eye, as we ſay, that moſt of the Doctrines which they have added to the Scriptures, make one way or other, for the honour or temporal advantage of the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(9thly)</hi> Again, following the Scriptures, we ſhall embrace a Religion of admirable ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and doctrine is even loaded with an infinity of weak, child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, unſavory Superſtitions and Ceremonies: under which its own Children have groaned and heavily complained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(10thly)</hi> Thoſe Holy Books alſo teach us, that we muſt not promiſe our ſelves ſalvation, unleſs we effectually mortifie all our evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts; and forſaking every ſin whatſoever, betake our ſelves to the practice of all Chriſtian Vertue: But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church opens an eaſier and broader way to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94132:166"/>
Salvation; permitting at leaſt this to be taught for as good and Catholick Doctrine as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that though a Man have continued all his life long in a courſe of ſin, without the practice of any vertue, he may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be let into Heaven by an act of attrition at the hour of Death, if joyned with confeſſion, or by an act of Contrition without Confeſſion. And therefore in this and ſeveral other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, the Religion of that Church is not ſo holy, as the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles delivered in the Scriptures: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is not ſo likely to come, from the Fountain of Holineſs and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(11thly)</hi> But whatſoever ways they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deviſe, to humour Mens depraved ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, we are ſure of this advantage by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Scriptures, which they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to by following their Church. That if we happen to entertain an erroneous opinion, grounded, as we think, upon ſome place of Scripture, it is implicitly retracted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by our precedent full and intire aſſent to all things contained in the Scriptures; and our general reſolution to hold nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, nor admit any thing (as neceſſary to ſalvation) that cannot be proved by them. Which makes the error that we unwittingly and unwillingly hold againſt the Scriptures, leſs dangerous: becauſe our adherence to the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94132:166"/>
Scriptures is nearer, cloſer and firmer, than it is to our particular error. Whereas by following their Church, not knowing what it is (whether the whole Body of People in that Communion, or a General Council, or the <hi>Pope,</hi> in, or out of a Council) we ſhall have no ſuch excuſe for our errors: but they will be rather much aggravated, by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering ſo ſtrictly to a doubtful and uncertain Rule; unto which the People in that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſticking cloſer, than they do to the Word of God, it leſſens the value of all the Truths which they believe; and doubles the guilt of all their errors.</p>
               <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> as this is a great ſatisfaction to our ſelves, ſo there is this to be added for the comfort of others alſo. That by following the Scriptures, we ſhall learn to bear with one another in our different opinions, about things which cannot thereby be determined; nay, in things which are not directly againſt it, or wherein we are not yet ſufficiently inſtructed: But by following the <hi>Roman</hi> Church we ſhall be taught to paſs the heavieſt ſentences upon all thoſe, that believe not in all things, as we do; nay, to take the ſevereſt courſes with them, though they be Men of the moſt innocent and uſeful lives; conforming themſelves in all things to the Precepts of Chriſt Jeſus, and to the Authority of their Governors for his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94132:167"/>
ſake, where it doth not manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Him.</p>
               <p>To conclude this, we for our parts are of the ſame mind, even towards them, which <hi>Grotius</hi> before obſerved the Apoſtles were of towards the <hi>Jews: From whom,</hi> ſaith he (and let the words be taken, as if ſpoken by us, to thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion) <hi>they would not ſo much as exact an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their happineſs, in being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the heavy Yoke of Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies that lay upon them: But, if they would admit of the Commandments of Chriſt, which are full of all goodneſs, eaſily permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to follow what courſe of life they pleaſed in matters of indifferency; provided they would not impoſe the neceſſity of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them upon others.</hi>

               <p>UPON theſe terms we are ready to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them; and I conclude all with this memorable Propoſal, which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus</hi> made in a Letter to <hi>Johannes Slechta,</hi> a Friend of his in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

               <p>
                  <hi>This would reconcile People to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>if all things were not ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly defined, and made a matter of Faith, which we would have to belong to it: but thoſe only which are evidently expreſſed in the Holy Scriptures; or without which we do not ſee any way to be ſaved.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To this purpoſe a few things are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and a few things may be ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded than a great many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now out of one Article, we make Six Hundred: ſome of which are ſuch, that, without indangering Piety, we may either be ignorant, or doubt of them. And, ſuch is the nature of Mankind, that what is once defined, we hold tooth and nail; and will by no means part with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when all's done, the ſumm of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Philoſophy lies in this; That we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all our Hope to be placed in God, who freely gives us all things by his Son Jeſus; by whoſe Death we are redeemed, into whoſe Body we are planted by Baptiſm; that being dead to the luſts of this World, we may live according to his Doctrine and Example; not only abſtaining from all evil, but indeavouring to deſerve well of every Body: assd that if any adverſity happen, we bear it couragiouſly, in hope of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which, without all doubt, waits for
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94132:168"/>
all pious Perſons at the coming of Chriſt: and that we make ſuch progreſs from vertue to vertue; as notwithſtanding to arrogate nothing to our ſelves, but to aſcribe all the good, that is in us, or that we can do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe things chiefly are to be inculcated, and beaten into the minds of Men; ſo that they become, as it were, their Nature. But if any will ſearch into thoſe things, which are more abſtruſe about the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Hypoſtaſis of Christ, or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that they may raiſe their minds the higher, and draw them from things here below; let them do ſo: provided that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body be not compelied preſently to believe, what ſeems good to this or that Perſon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For as out of large Deeds ariſe ſooner Law-ſuits; ſo are differences begotten, by very many definitions.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And let us not be aſhamed to anſwer to ſome things, God knows how it may be done: it is ſufficient for me to believe that it is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know that Chriſt's pure Body and Blood is to be purely received by thoſe that are pure; and that He would have this to be a moſt holy token and pledge, both of his love to us, and of our Christian concord among our ſelves. And therefore I will examine my ſelf, and make a ſtrict ſearch; whether

               <p>
                  <hi>But how the Ten Predicaments are there, how the Bread is Tranſubſtantiated by the myſtical words,</hi> (or, as He explains himſelf in the latter end of his Book, upon lxxxiv.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude, it will be of great moment to eſtabliſh the concord of the World; if all ſecular Princes, and especially the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>would abſtain from all appearance of Tyranny, and of Covetouſneſs.</hi>
